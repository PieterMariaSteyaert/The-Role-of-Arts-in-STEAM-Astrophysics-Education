Computer Assisted Proofs and Automated Methods in Mathematics Education,"This survey paper is an expanded version of an invited keynote at the ThEdu'22 workshop, August 2022, in Haifa (Israel). After a short introduction on the developments of CAS, DGS and other useful technologies, we show implications in Mathematics Education, and in the broader frame of STEAM Education. In particular, we discuss the transformation of Mathematics Education into exploration-discovery-conjecture-proof scheme, avoiding usage as a black box . This scheme fits well into the so-called 4 C's of 21st Century Education. Communication and Collaboration are emphasized not only between humans, but also between machines, and between man and machine. Specific characteristics of the outputs enhance the need of Critical Thinking. The usage of automated commands for exploration and discovery is discussed, with mention of limitations where they exist. We illustrate the topic with examples from parametric integrals (describing a ""cognitive neighborhood"" of a mathematical notion), plane geometry, and the study of plane curves (envelopes, isoptic curves). Some of the examples are fully worked out, others are explained and references are given.",Thierry Noah Dana-Picard,10.4204/EPTCS.375.2,ProQuest
Agrotechnical indicators of working bodies for tillage of fallow fields in summer,"The article discusses the options of working bodies for tillage of steam fields in the summer. These studies are aimed at obtaining agrotechnical indicators of the technological process of tillage of steam fields. In particular, the design of the working body in the form of a flat one-sided paw is proposed. Laboratory and field studies were carried out to determine the qualitative indicators of the technological process of fine tillage, with all variants of working bodies. During the research, such indicators were established as: the optimal (recommended) speed of the unit, the depth of tillage by working bodies, the width of the unit (working), the average square deviation in the depth of processing and the width of the grip. The aggregate composition of the soil was assessed by fractions, the content of erosive-hazardous particles before and after the passage of the unit, pruning or destruction of weeds and the ridge of the field surface after the passage of the unit. Data on the dynamics of soil moisture after several treatments of steam fields with various variants of working bodies were obtained. As a result of the research, it was found that the working body in the form of a flat one-sided paw, in comparison with the working body of a serial steam cultivator, allows to reduce the depth of processing by 1.6 cm (up to 5.2 cm), to reduce the value of the combiness of the treated surface by 2.4-3.4 cm, while ensuring complete pruning of weeds both annual and perennial. The variants of working bodies considered in the article for processing steam fields in the summer and the studies carried out to determine their quality indicators will allow creating machine-technological units for promising mechanized technologies of tillage in arid agriculture.","Kambulov, S I;Rykov, V B;Bozhko, I V;Podlesniy, D S;Chikrizova, V B;Ivanova, T A",10.1088/1755-1315/1154/1/012050,ProQuest
Insights from bauhaus innovation for education and workplaces in a post-pandemic world,"This paper examines Bauhaus School (1919–1933) innovation and relevance today. The School is a landmark in the history of design as a discipline and the development of design education. The School was also a workplace, commercialising Bauhaus-designed products. While drawing global interest in its innovations, the School faced resistance in Germany because it challenged conventions. This problem raises the questions: How did the School-workplace generate innovations amid the calamity of post-war Germany, and what is the significance of the Bauhaus for post-pandemic education and workplaces one hundred years on? The concept of ‘transgression’ is used to understand innovation at the Bauhaus School-workplace. Haraway discusses transgressive practices that disrupt established knowledges, moving ways of thinking and doing in new directions. Analysis of workplace learning research reveals that three interfacing dimensions make up innovation: (1) workplace environments, (2) the culture-order that facilitates innovation, and (3) learning in practice in authentic settings. This qualitative case study reports on how Bauhaus innovation emerged at the intersection of these key dimensions. There are surprising commonalities between the Bauhaus approach to innovation in challenging times and contemporary thinking about supporting innovation which are relevant to education, particularly STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) education, and workplaces in a world affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. Thus, encouraging people who challenge boundaries, rules or ‘the way things are’ can support innovation. This paper addresses a gap in workplace learning research on interrelated dimensions of innovation which the Bauhaus recognized. The study also offers an innovative approach to&#xa0;the examination of innovation across time and space whereas most contemporary studies of innovation focus on the present. Further, conceptualizing innovation as transgression offers a new way of thinking about innovation in design and in the workplace.","White-Hancock, Lorraine",10.1007/s10798-022-09729-2,ProQuest
"RISING Strong: Sustainability through Art, Science, and Collective Community Action","The objective of this research is to offer a qualitative analysis of adult STEAM (science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics) learning in a community setting, with a focus on sustainability and climate action. To date, much research on STEAM learning has been directed towards youth and children in formal educational settings. Our qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with community participants, artists, and scientists over the course of a six-month initiative in Ireland allowed us to develop a rich picture of a multi-faceted STEAM project that held space for both a social change agenda and a learning agenda. In our findings, we identified several contributing factors to transformative learning and changed feelings about climate change, including pride of place, the development of strong interpersonal relationships, and an emerging sense of collective agency through a shared emotional and affective journey. To design for meaningful, community-level climate action, we argue that learning may be supported in, with and through STEAM. Our study also showcases the value of the arts and aesthetic experiences to embrace dissensus when tackling a complex issue like climate change through STEAM education.","Hurley, Mairéad;Roche, Joseph",10.3390/su152014800,ProQuest
Multi-Walled CNTs/BiVO<sub>4</sub> Heterostructures for Solar-Driven Evaporation System and Efficient Photocatalytic Activity against Oxytetracycline,"Developing a sustainable environment requires addressing primitive water scarcity and water contamination. Antibiotics such as oxytetracycline (OTC) may accumulate in the environment and in the human body, increasing the risks to the ecosystem. The treatment of polluted water and the production of potable water can be achieved in a variety of ways, including photodegradation, solar distillation, and filtration. Freshwater supplies can be increased by implementing energy-efficient technologies for the production of clean water. Solar water evaporation combined with photocatalytic degradation and sterilization offers a promising avenue for integration into the clean water and energy production fields. The present study reports the synthesis of a 3D solar steam generator comprised of BiVO 4 and carbon nanotubes (CNT) nanocomposite decorated over a cigarette filter as the light-to-heat conversion layer for solar steam generation. The BiVO 4 @CNT-based 3D solar evaporator over the hydrophilic cellulosic fibers of the cigarette filter endowed excellent evaporation rates (2.36 kg m −2 h −1 ) under 1 kW m −2 solar irradiation, owing to its superior hydrophilicity and broadband solar absorption (96%) equipped with localized heating at microscale thermal confinement optimized by the minimum thermal conductivity of the overall system. Furthermore, the BiVO 4 @CNT composite exhibited a heightened photo activity up to 83% of the photodegradation of oxytetracycline (OTC) antibiotic due to the inhibition of charge recombination from the industrial effluents. This approach transforms the water-energy nexus into a synergistic bond that offers opportunities to meet expected demand, rather than being competitive.","Alomar, Muneerah;Arshad, Naila;Muhammad Sultan Irshad;Abdelmohsen, Shaimaa A M;Ahmed, Iftikhar;Alhoshani, Nawal;Alqarni, Areej S",10.3390/nano13202764,ProQuest
Is There Deep Learning on Mars? STEAM Education in an Inquiry-Based Out-of-School Setting,"Learning intervention based on a ""Mars and Space"" exhibition was designed according to STEAM-education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) principles and practices in order to bridge the gap between formal and informal learning. The cognitive learning of 12-year-old students in Finland (""N"" = 306) showed a sustained level for a six months period. The results of this study provided evidence that situational motivation was enhanced by interest in school science in the STEAM science exhibition context. This led to better cognitive learning results in the post-knowledge test. Thus, interest and situational motivation were the first steps, and the superficial situational motivation seemed to successfully change into content-based intrinsic motivation with longer-lasting, deep learning outcomes. STEAM intervention apparently produced long-term learning, and this exhibition learning setting is shown to provide an appropriate platform to reach the deeper layers to successfully retain knowledge. Boys' scores rose even in the delayed test. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) to assess the effects on individual, motivational and situational interest in learning, situation motivation is shown to work as a catalyst and acting as a catalyst and also acted as a stepping stone for intrinsic motivation as part of relative autonomy (RAI) and a deep learning strategy.","Salmi, Hannu S.;Thuneberg, Helena;Bogner, Franz X.",10.1080/10494820.2020.1823856,ProQuest
Using Direct Solar Energy Conversion in Distillation via Evacuated Solar Tube with and without Nanomaterials,"As is widely known, the issue of freshwater scarcity affects practically all people, and all are looking for innovative and workable ways to attempt to solve this issue. In this work, a novel method of desalination is proposed. The proposed system consists of a solar collector (PTSC), evacuated pipe (EP), condenser (CU), and separation unit (SU). The working principle of the system is heating the feed saline water using the PTSC and EP and controlling the water flow rate to control the output conditions of the EP. The produced vapor is therefore separated from salty water using the SU. In addition, the generated steam is condensed into the CU to produce a freshwater distillate. Consequently, the effect of solar radiation on the affecting temperatures was tested. In addition, the effect of using different water flow rates (6, 7.5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 L/h) inside the EP on the system productivity was investigated. The primary findings of this work may be highlighted in relation to the experiments conducted. At midday, when ultraviolet irradiance reached its highest, the EP’s water flow entrance and outflow had the largest temperature differential. In addition, the lower the water flow rate inside the EP, the higher the water temperature, the higher the evaporation rate of the system, and the greater the freshwater productivity of the system. At 6 L/h, the water’s highest temperature was 92 °C. Moreover, the best performance of the system was obtained at 7.5 L/h, where the freshwater production and average daily effectiveness of the distillate process were 44.7 L/daytime and 59.6%, respectively. As well, the productivity of EP was augmented by around 11.86% when using graphite nanoparticles. Additionally, the distilled freshwater from the system operating at the flow rate of 7.5 L/h costs 0.0085 $/L.","Saleh, Bahaa;Essa, Fadl A;Omara, Zakaria M;Ahmed, Mohamed H;El-Sebaey, Mahmoud S;Mogaji Taye Stephen;Lingala Syam Sundar;Qasim, Mohammed A;Ramana, Eskilla Venkata;Shanmugan, Sengottiyan;Elsheikh, Ammar H",10.3390/pr11061734,ProQuest
Overview of Solar Steam Devices from Materials and Structures,"The global shortage of freshwater supply has become an imminent problem. The high energy consumption of traditional desalination technology cannot meet the demand for sustainable energy development. Therefore, exploring new energy sources to obtain pure water has become one of the effective ways to solve the freshwater resource crisis. In recent years, solar steam technology which utilizes solar energy as the sole input source for photothermal conversion has shown to be sustainable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly, providing a viable low-carbon solution for freshwater supply. This review summarizes the latest developments in solar steam generators. The working principle of steam technology and the types of heating systems are described. The photothermal conversion mechanisms of different materials are illustrated. Emphasis is placed on describing strategies to optimize light absorption and improve steam efficiency from material properties to structural design. Finally, challenges in the development of solar steam devices are pointed out, aiming to provide new ideas for the development of solar steam devices and alleviate the shortage of freshwater resources.","Liu, Chang;Yin, Zhenhao;Hou, Yue;Yin, Chengri;Yin, Zhenxing",10.3390/polym15122742,ProQuest
Design and Performance Analysis of a Novel Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) with a Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Bottom Cycle,"The integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC) system is a proven solution for grid-connected power generation from solar energy. How to further improve the ISCC system efficiency and propose a more efficient system solution has become a research focus. A novel gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) benchmark system is proposed by replacing the conventional steam Rankine bottom cycle with a supercritical CO 2 Brayton cycle, whose output power and efficiency are increased by 9.07 MW and 1.3%, respectively, compared to those of the conventional GTCC system. Furthermore, the novel ISCC systems are established with the parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) and the solar tower (ST) collector coupled to the novel GTCC system. Thermal performance analysis, exergy performance analysis, and the sensitivity analysis of the ISCC systems have been performed, and the results show that the system efficiencies of both ISCC systems are lower than that of the GTCC system, at 57.1% and 57.5%, respectively, but the power generation of the ISCC system with PTC is greater than that of the benchmark system, while that of the ISCC system with ST is less than that of the benchmark system. The photoelectric efficiency of the ISCC system with PTC is 27.6%, which is 2.1% greater than that of ISCC system with ST. In the ISCC system with PTC, the components with the highest exergy destruction and the lowest exergy efficiency are the combustion chamber, and PTC, respectively. ST is the component with the highest exergy destruction and the lowest exergy efficiency in the ISCC system with ST. With the increase in direct normal irradiance (DNI), the total output power, solar energy output power, and photoelectric efficiency of the ISCC system with PTC increase, while the system efficiency decreases; the solar energy output power and photoelectric efficiency of the ISCC system with ST increase, while the total output power and system efficiency decrease. The photoelectric efficiency of the ISCC system with PTC is greater when the DNI is greater than 600 W/m 2 ; conversely, the photoelectric efficiency of the ISCC system with ST is greater. After sensitivity analysis, the optimal intercooler pressure for the ISCC system is 11.3 MPa.","Zhang, Zuxian;Duan, Liqiang;Wang, Zhen;Ren, Yujie",10.3390/en16124833,ProQuest
Normalizing Black Students/Youth and Their Families' Digital and STEAM Literacies,"Due to the paucity of research that focuses on the digital and STEAM literacy practices of Black students and youth and their families in home and community spaces, this article acts as a call for awareness to understand the already-existing digital practices that acknowledges and honors their racial, cultural, and social lives. Lewis Ellison addresses four primary questions that K-12 teachers must be aware of concerning Black parents, students and youth in digital and STEM spaces: Why are Black Students'/Youth and Families' Digital Literacy Practices important? What can we learn from Black Parents' Narratives about their Children's Digital and STEAM Literacies? What do Black Students/Youth Wish their Teachers Knew about Them? What Should Digital and STEM Literacy Practices Look Like for Black Students/Youth? These questions are important when thinking about Black students' and youth's digital literacy learning and proficiencies because as the education and political world keeps changing, they need digital literacy skills for every area of their lives. Once we understand the roles we play in centering their lives and practices, then we can advance teacher education, and then we can begin a discussion to normalize Black students and their families' digital and STEAM literacies and practices.","Lewis Ellison, Tisha",10.1002/trtr.2182,ProQuest
Study on the Selection of Single-Screw Steam Compressors in Industrial Steam Supply,"Both direct and indirect heating compression methods were proposed to satisfy the requirement of industrial steam compression and supply. The compression process in a single-screw compressor was analyzed with the determination of different inlet and outlet boundary conditions. Considering the misalignment of meshing pairs caused by the offset of the star wheel axis and screw origin, the differential expansion of the vertical meshing pair was further analyzed. The inner ring of the sealing end face, the wall of the inner ring of the bearing at the inlet and outlet ends, and the bottom surface of the bracket were analyzed by different coordinate systems and different constraints, thus facilitating the design and selection of the single screw. The critical point for the design of a steam-type single-screw compressor is an outlet temperature of 350 °C and an outlet volume flow rate of 130 m 3 /min. At a flow rate of 130 m 3 /min, when the temperature exceeds 350 °C, the reliability of the compressor is still limited, and the differential expansion of the meshing pair exceeds 0.3 mm. In addition, superheating of steam can be improved by applying a centrifugal compressor with cascade compression and centrifugal compression in conjunction with reflux adjustment at the compression outlet.","Zhang, Pan;Ke, Xiwei;Wang, Weiliang;Tang, Xueyu;Lyu, Junfu;Tang, Qinghong",10.3390/en16104199,ProQuest
A novel dual feedwater circuit for a parabolic trough solar power plant,"The validated dynamic model of a parabolic trough power plant (PTPP) is improved by the combination of a new feedwater circuit (feedwater/HTF circuit) and a reference feedwater circuit (feedwater/steam circuit) as well as the development of the steam turbine model. Such design represents the first effort of research to utilize a dual feedwater circuit inside the PTPP to increase the power output in the daylight from 50 to 68 MW el and raise night operating hours at a lower cost. The purpose of increasing the operating night hours at a power (48 MW el ) as in the reference PTPP is to get rid of the fossil fuel backup system and rely only on the absorbed solar energy and the stored energy in the molten salt. During daylight hours, the feedwater circuit is operated using Feedwater/HTF. In the transient period, the feedwater/HTF circuit will gradually be closed due to a decrease in solar radiation. Furthermore, the rest of the nominal feedwater mass flow rate (49&#xa0;kg/s) is gradually replenished from the feedwater/steam circuit. After sunset, the entirety of the feedwater is heated based on the steam extracted from the turbine. The purpose of this improvement is to raise the number of nightly operational hours by reducing the nominal load from 61.93 to 48&#xa0;MW el as a result of low energy&#xa0;demand during the evening hours. Therefore, a comparison study between the reference model and this optimization&#xa0;(optimization&#xa0;2) is conducted for clear days (26th–27th/June and 13th–14th/July 2010) in order to understand the influence of dual feedwater circuit. The comparison indicates that the operational hours of the power block (PB) will be obviously increased. Moreover, this improvement reduces based on the fossil fuel system at night. As the last step, an economic analysis was performed on the costs of the referenced and the optimized PTPP as a function of the levelized energy cost (LEC). The results illustrate that the specific energy cost of a PTPP with 7.5&#xa0;h of storage capacity is lowered by about 14.5% by increasing the output of the PTPP from 50 to 68 MW el .","Al-Maliki, Wisam Abed Kattea;Alsaedi, Sajda S.;Khafaji, Hayder Q.

An Experimental Study on the Implementation of a STEAM-Based Learning Module in Science Education,"Over the last decade, there has been notable academic interest in the multidisciplinary studies of science education with the emergence of STEAM. Accordingly, this study aimed to conduct an experimental study to explore the effectiveness of a STEAM-based space-themed learning module in science education taught to primary school students. The sample of the study was 6th- and 7th-grade students from the Central Anatolia Region of Turkiye. The experimental group consisted of 180 students, whereas the control group consisted of 94 students. The STEAM-based learning module was applied to the students in the experimental group, and the traditional lecture-based approach was applied to students in the control group. The traditional education and intervention lasted eight weeks. The chi-square test and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the differences and associations between the variables. The results indicated that gender and academic achievement level were the two key factors determining the effectiveness of the STEAM-based learning module. The comparison of the pre-test and post-test scores indicated that the scores of the female students who participated in the module increased the most. This suggested that girls benefited more from the STEAM-based learning module than boys. Further, the lecture-based approach led to a decrease in some high-achieving students. The findings have implications for educational policymakers, curriculum developers, and syllabus designers.","Arpaci, Ibrahim;Muhammed Said Dogru;Kanj, Hassan;Ali, Nawaf;Bahari, Mahadi",10.3390/su15086807,ProQuest

Development of Spatial Abilities of Preadolescents: What Works?,"Creation in space and perception of spatial relations are important workplace skills that can be successfully developed in public education through the cooperation of art education, mathematics, and technology, the STEAM model that has been successfully employed in higher education. In a longitudinal school-based experiment, we enhanced the spatial skills of preadolescents through a STEAM-based educational programme. To design our methods of intervention in mathematics, visual arts, and information technology, we used the structure of spatial skills identified in previous studies. Developmental methods involved two- and three-dimensional visualisation tasks in real-life and virtual learning environments. We employed a pre- and post-hoc assessment design using a spatial ability task sequence standardised in Hungary that proved to be valid for assessing Slovak students as well. Authentic assessment tasks included real-life situations when visualisations of spatial relations were used for orientation and creation. Pre-test results showed significant differences between school classes: we identified high achievers and middle-to-low achievers. Our developmental programme was aimed at personalised talent development in the high-achieving classes and the general improvement of the performance of low achievers, raising insufficient pre-test results to an average post-test performance.","Szabó, Tibor;Babály, Bernadett;Pataiová, Helena;Kárpáti, Andrea",10.3390/educsci13030312,ProQuest
Superelastic 3D Assembled Clay/Graphene Aerogels for Continuous Solar Desalination and Oil/Organic Solvent Absorption,"Superelastic, arbitrary-shaped, and 3D assembled clay/graphene aerogels (CGAs) are fabricated using commercial foam as sacrificial skeleton. The CGAs possess superelasticity under compressive strain of 95% and compressive stress of 0.09–0.23&#xa0;MPa. The use of clay as skeletal support significantly reduces the use of graphene by 50%. The hydrophobic CGAs show high solvent absorption capacity of 186–519 times its own weight. Moreover, both the compression and combustion methods can be adopted for reusing the CGAs. In particular, it is demonstrated a design of 3D assembled hydrophilic CGA equipped with salt collection system for continuous solar desalination. Due to energy recovery and brine transport management promoted by this design, the 3D assembled CGA system exhibits an extremely high evaporation rate of 4.11&#xa0;kg&#xa0;m −2 &#xa0;h −1 and excellent salt-resistant property without salt precipitation even in 20&#xa0;wt% brine for continuous 36&#xa0;h illumination (1&#xa0;kW&#xa0;m −2 ), which is the best reported result from the solar desalination devices. More importantly, salts can be collected conveniently by squeezing and drying the solution out of the salt collection system. The work provides new insights into the design of 3D assembled CGAs and advances their applications in continuous solar desalination and efficient oil/organic solvent adsorption.","Ding, Meichun;Lu, Hao;Sun, Yongbin;He, Yujian;Yu, Jiahui;Kong, Huijun;Shao, Changxiang;Chen-Yang, Liu;Li, Chenwei",10.1002/advs.202205202,ProQuest
Selection of working fluids for solar organic Rankine cycle—A review,"The performance of renewable energy systems can be significantly improved if power is produced from low‐temperature heat sources. The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is suitable for producing power from low‐temperature heat sources. ORC finds applications alongside solar power, geothermal power, waste heat and biomass. ORC‐enabled systems can contribute significantly to raising the effectiveness of renewable power sources. Solar power, for example, can deliver affordable electricity to remote locations and small industries. By employing ORC, power generation is possible at lower temperatures on cloudy days. Its main difference from the steam Rankine cycle is its working fluid. The ORC makes use of an organic, high molecular mass fluid as the working fluid. Compared to steam Rankine cycles, ORC works at a lower temperature (&lt;250°C) and pressure. The only working fluid in the steam Rankine cycle is water, but the ORC can operate on hundreds of different working fluids. The design and performance of ORC systems are entirely dependent upon the suitable working fluid and, hence identification of the working fluid for ORCs is of utmost importance for diverse applications. Properties of working fluid have a considerable impact on the efficiency of the system. The main objective of this study is to identify the most suitable organic fluids having characteristics necessary for use in solar ORCs. In addition, a detailed review of the various types of heat transfer fluids now available in the market that are often used in ORC systems was conducted. This research assists in selecting the most appropriate organic fluids for various solar ORC applications in terms of operating circumstances.","Arjunan, Pradeep;Joselin Herbert Gnana Muthu;Suresh Lal Somanasari Radha;Suryan, Abhilash",10.1002/er.7723,ProQuest

The potential of citizen science data to complement satellite and airborne lidar tree height measurements: lessons from The GLOBE Program,"The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program is an international science, citizen science, and education program through which volunteers in participating countries collect environmental data in support of Earth system science.

This paper describes tree heights data collected through the GO application and identifies sources of error in data collection. We also illustrate how the ground-based citizen science data collected in the GO application can be used in conjunction with ICESat-2 tree height observations from two locations in the United States: Grand Mesa, Colorado, and Greenbelt, Maryland. Initial analyses indicate that data location accuracy and the scientific relevance of data density should be considered in order to align GLOBE tree height data with satellite-based data collections. These recommendations are intended to inform the improved implementation of citizen science environmental data collection in scientific work and to document a use case of the GLOBE Trees data for the science research community.","Enterkine, Josh;Campbell, Brian A;Kohl, Holli;Glenn, Nancy F;Weaver, Kristen;Overoye, David;Danke, Deanna",10.1088/1748-9326/ac77a2,ProQuest
IoT with a Soft Touch: A Modular Remote Sensing Platform for STE(A)M Applications,"Besides wide attraction in the industry, IoT is being used to advance STEM and STEAM education across a range of education levels. This work presents a remote sensing platform, named IoT with a Soft Touch, developed to achieve two goals. First, it aims to lower the technicality, stimulating the students to do STE(A)M. Second, the technology is to be used in `softer' applications (e.g., environmental and health care), thereby aiming to attract a more diverse set of student profiles. Students can easily build a wireless sensing device, with a specific application in mind. The modular design of the platform and an intuitive graphical configurator tool allows them to tailor the device's functionality to their needs. The sensor's data is transmitted wirelessly with LoRaWAN. The data can be viewed and analyzed on a dashboard, or the raw data can be extracted for further processing, e.g., as part of the school's STE(A)M curriculum.

Influence of different ratio of CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> and foaming additives on supercritical foaming of expanded thermoplastic polyurethane,"Expanded thermoplastic polyurethane (ETPU) foam materials with superelasticity for footwear application were developed and investigated. ETPU foams with different ratios of CO 2 /N 2 as foaming agents and ETPU foams prepared by pure nitrogen foaming with different kinds of foaming additives were prepared by supercritical (Sc) foaming technology, which further made into sheet forms through the steam molding process. TPU foam exhibits better cell structure, crystallization performance, and mechanical strength with the increased CO 2 proportion. Further, the foams using 25% CO 2 -75% N 2 and 50% CO 2 -50% N 2 , showed a lower density and excellent resilience and cyclic-compression performance. However, an increase of N 2 ratio improves the dimensional stability and compression set of the foam. The introduction of foaming aids enhances the interaction between Sc-N 2 and TPU. The ETPU foam prepared under the same conditions has a smaller density and a larger expansion ratio. Especially the ETPU foam prepared by Sc-N 2 using monofluorodichloroethane as the foaming assistant as a co-blowing agent, the decrease in cell size (from 117.9 to 19.6 p.m) and density (from 0.175 to 0.139 g/cm 3 ) has observed.

NiFe 2 O 4 is one of the oxygen carriers with the best comprehensive hydrogen production performance, but the oxygen carrier still has the disadvantages of low hydrogen production and poor reaction stability. In this paper, a small amount of Ce was doped in the oxygen carrier to improve the hydrogen production efficiency. And the reaction stability of the oxygen carrier was improved by loading an inert carrier. The experimental results showed that the 6 wt% Ce‐NiFe 2 O 4 oxygen carrier had the highest H 2 yield, and the hydrogen yield per unit mass of oxygen carrier was increased from 194 to 367 mL/g. Thermodynamic simulation and characterization results showed that the doping of Ce could enhance the oxygen release capacity and hydrogen production capacity. In the cyclic experiment, due to the damage of the oxygen carrier spinel structure and the sintering of oxygen carrier particles, the reaction activity of the 6 wt% Ce‐NiFe 2 O 4 oxygen carrier gradually reduced and the hydrogen production in the steam reactor decreased significantly after 15 cycles. After the loading of Al 2 O 3 inert support on the 6 wt% Ce‐NiFe 2 O 4 oxygen carrier, the hydrogen production was greatly improved and remained stable after 15 cycles. The modification of the oxygen carrier could not only increase the hydrogen production but also the economic efficiency for the reduced amount of Ce and Ni.","Gao, Jie;Ge Pu;Wang, Pengcheng;Yuan, Cong;Jia, Shuaihui",10.1002/er.7346,ProQuest

"""From Atoms to Stars"": An Interactive Theatre Play Based on 'The Little Prince' Novella to Describe Spatial Thinking","The implementation of theatre as a didactic tool for teaching science provides a new perspective on the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in the construction of meaningful learning experiences. Gamification and collaborative work are functional strategies to teach scientific concepts in a creative way. However, there are still conceptual issues about spatial thinking that are difficult for students to understand owing to the lack of visualization of objects and their development through a characteristic chronicle. Here we show an innovative way to unifying science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) careers through the development of an interactive theatrical play inspired by ""The Little Prince"" novella, to promote a culture of integration of science, theatre and literature. One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that the didactic strategies used are key ingredients in order to design an unique theatre play based on a link between history of atomic models and literature towards full understanding of spatial macroscales and microscales thinking. Due to the successful in the qualitative assessment results, we are devising to continue exploring the use of these didactic strategies to achieve an integrated and greater impact on students' learning processes.","Acuña-Umaña, K.;Gómez-Quirós, Carla;Herrera-Sancho, Oscar Andrey",10.1088/1361-6552/ac6eb5,ProQuest
Towards Closing STEAM Diversity Gaps: A Grey Review of Existing Initiatives,"Although STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math) and student-centered instruction are growing rapidly in popularity, their reach is not adequately distributed across diversity groups (including individuals of different genders, economic backgrounds, immigrant backgrounds, abilities, and races, among other characteristics). The CreaSTEAM project intends to address diversity gaps by developing STEAM-Labs, student-centered spaces that combine components of fab labs, media labs, and user labs to specifically target diversity gaps. This paper carried out an informal PRISMA systematic review of a collection of 124 worldwide STEAM diversity initiatives to gather data on existing best practices that will be used in the STEAM-Labs. The review studied the geographic distributions, organizational structures, founding years, and activity offerings of the initiatives, along with the dataset’s overall STEAM content area prevalence and diversity target area prevalence. STEM was the most common approach, and gender was the most common diversity target area. Since 2010 initiative creation has increased, with most growth in gender-focused initiatives.","Hasti, Henry;Amo-Filva, Daniel;Fonseca, David;Verdugo-Castro, Sonia;García-Holgado, Alicia;García-Peñalvo, Francisco José",10.3390/app122412666,ProQuest
Math Learning in a Science Museum—Proposal for a Workshop Design Based on STEAM Strategy to Learn Mathematics. The Case of the Cryptography Workshop,"In mathematics teaching, great efforts are made, and diverse teaching strategies are employed in order to facilitate students’ learning process. Informal environments have proven to be conducive and motivating spaces for science learning. In particular, science museums can be used as a complement and collaborate in order to leverage each of their strengths to motivate mathematics learning. Educational models give a global explanation to the learning process. Taking into account all these aspects and considering van Hiele’s model as didactic reference, we propose the design of a general workshop that has among its objectives the learning of mathematics. To do this, we start from the three main elements and processes set forth in van Hiele’s model: insight, reasoning levels and learning phases. The insight or student’s competence are formulated through Hoffer’s abilities, and for the development of the activities of the learning phases, the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and maths) strategy. Once the general proposal has been made, we use it to design a scientific workshop for learning mathematics about cryptography. Our greatest challenge was in generating activities adapted to the established requirements. It would be interesting, for future works, to design research to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposal presented. Moreover, it would be interesting to develop a proposal for assessing student learning.","Roldán-Zafra, Juan;Perea, Carmen",10.3390/math10224335,ProQuest
Nanocomposite-Enhanced Efficient Evaporation System for Solar-Driven Seawater Desalination—An Optimized Design for Clean Water Production,"Solar-driven evaporation is a promising technology for desalinating seawater and wastewater without mechanical or electrical energy. The approaches to obtaining fresh water with higher evaporation efficiency are essential to address the water-scarcity issue in remote sensing areas. Herein, we report a highly efficient solar evaporator derived from the nanocomposite of anatase TiO 2 /activated carbon (TiO 2 /AC), which was coated on washable cotton fabric using the dip-dry technique for solar water evaporation. The ultra-black fabric offers enhanced solar absorption (93.03%), hydrophilic water transport, and an efficient evaporation rate of 1.65 kg/m 2 h under 1 kW m −2 or one sun solar intensity. More importantly, the sideways water channels and centralized thermal insulation of the designed TiO 2 /AC solar evaporator accumulated photothermal heat at the liquid and air interface along with an enhanced surface temperature of 40.98 °C under one sun. The fabricated solar evaporator desalinated seawater (3.5 wt%) without affecting the evaporation rates, and the collected condensed water met the standard of drinking water set by the World Health Organization (WHO). This approach eventually enabled the engineering design groups to develop the technology pathways as well as optimum conditions for low-cost, scalable, efficient, and sustainable solar-driven steam generators to cope with global water scarcity.","Zhou, Wei;Muhammad Sultan Irshad;Arshad, Naila;Noureen, Laila;Ahmed, Iftikhar;Mushtaq, Naveed;Muhammad Sohail Asghar;Hayat, Qaisar;Ghazanfar, Uzma;Idrees, Muhammad;Naeem Shahzad;Lu, Yuzheng",10.3390/nano12193296,ProQuest

Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Diatomite-Decorated Cotton Evaporator for Continuous Solar Steam Generation and Water Treatment,"Improving the evaporation rate of solar steam generation (SSG) has always been a research hotspot to solve the shortage of water resources. Using cotton, Fe 3 O 4 , polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and diatomite (DM) as raw materials, DM/PVA/Fe 3 O 4 @cotton composites with both firmness and hydrophilicity were prepared. Fe 3 O 4 has a wide range of light absorption characteristics and good photothermal conversion performance, and is an ideal photothermal conversion material. PVA enhances the adhesion between Fe 3 O 4 , cotton and DM and enhances the hardness of the sample and the internal porous structure. The existence of DM greatly improves the hydrophilicity of the sample, ensuring that the water in the lower layer can be continuously transported to the surface of the sample, and DM makes the surface of the sample rough, which reduces the reflection of sunlight and improves the efficiency of light heat conversion. Under one-sun irradiation, the temperature of the sample surface increases by 52.6 °C, the evaporation rate can reach 1.32 kg m −2 h −1 and the evaporation efficiency is 82.9%. Using this sample as the photothermal conversion layer of the SSG device, the removal rate of salt ions in seawater is more than 98% and the removal rate of heavy metal ions in sewage is close to 100%. This work provides a new idea and design method for SSG in the field of seawater desalination and sewage treatment.","Bai, Zhi;Xu, Haifeng;Yang, Bo;Yao, Jixin;Li, Guang;Guo, Kai;Wang, Nan;Liang, Nannan",10.3390/ma15176110,ProQuest
Edge Computing for IoT-Enabled Smart Grid: The Future of Energy,"The explosive development of electrical engineering in the early 19th century marked the birth of the 2nd industrial revolution, with the use of electrical energy in place of steam power, as well as changing the history of human development. The versatility of electricity allows people to apply it to a multitude of fields such as transportation, heat applications, lighting, telecommunications, and computers. Nowadays, with the breakout development of science and technology, electric energy sources are formed by many different technologies such as hydroelectricity, solar power, wind power, coal power, etc. These energy sources are connected to form grid systems to transmit electricity to cities, businesses and homes for life and work. Electrical energy today has become the backbone of all modern technologies. To ensure the safe, reliable and energy-efficient operation of the grid, a wide range of grid management applications have been proposed. However, a significant challenge for monitoring and controlling grids is service response time. In recent times, to solve this problem, smart grid management applications based on IoT and edge computing have been proposed. In this work, we perform a comprehensive survey of edge computing for IoT-enabled smart grid systems. In addition, recent smart grid frameworks based on IoT and edge computing are discussed, important requirements are presented, and the open issues and challenges are indicated. We believe that in the Internet of Things era, the smart grid will be the future of energy. We hope that these study results will contribute important guidelines for in-depth research in the field of smart grids and green energy in the future.","Quy Nguyen Minh;Van-Hau, Nguyen;Vu Khanh Quy;Le, Anh Ngoc;Chehri, Abdellah;Jeon, Gwanggil",10.3390/en15176140,ProQuest
The City as a Tool for STEAM Education: Problem-Posing in the Context of Math Trails,"This study presents an experience that combines problem-posing and Math Trails in the context of future teachers’ instruction. Pre-service teachers in the third year of their studies were faced with the design of tasks to be included in Math Trails for primary school students. The study analyzes, from a quantitative approach, 117 tasks contained in 11 Math Trails. The analysis was performed on the basis of classification variables (grade, mathematical content and object or real element involved in every task) and research variables which provide information about the nature of the tasks (procedural vs. problem-solving, level of cognitive demand, degree of contextualization, openness and creativity). Additionally, relationships between the different categories of analysis have been studied. The results reveal certain biases in the tasks in relation to the contents addressed (an abundance of tasks with a geometric component and a scarcity of tasks involving algebra or probability concepts). Most of the tasks are presented in a real context. However, a higher percentage of procedural tasks than problem-solving tasks is observed, with a predominance of low openness, creativity and cognitive demand. These results provide useful lines of work to address difficulties faced by future teachers in the STEAM field.","Martínez-Jiménez, Enrique;Álvaro Nolla de Celis;Fernández-Ahumada, Elvira",10.3390/math10162995,ProQuest
A reconfigurable and magnetically responsive assembly for dynamic solar steam generation,"Interfacial solar vapor generation is a promising technique to efficiently get fresh water from seawater or effluent. However, for the traditional static evaporation models, further performance improvement has encountered bottlenecks due to the lack of dynamic management and self-regulation on the evolving water movement and phase change in the evaporation process. Here, a reconfigurable and magnetically responsive evaporator with conic arrays is developed through the controllable and reversible assembly of graphene wrapped Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. Different from the traditional structure-rigid evaporation architecture, the deformable and dynamic assemblies could reconfigure themselves both at macroscopic and microscopic scales in response to the variable magnetic field. Thus, the internal water transportation and external vapor diffusion are greatly promoted simultaneously, leading to a 23% higher evaporation rate than that of static counterparts. Further, well-designed hierarchical assembly and dynamic evaporation system can boost the evaporation rate to a record high level of 5.9 kg m −2 h −1 . This proof-of-concept work demonstrates a new direction for development of high performance water evaporation system with the ability of dynamic reconfiguration and reassembly. Despite a promising water harvesting approach solar steam generation low efficiency remains a challenging obstacle. Here, authors present a macro- and microscopically reconfigurable and magnetically responsive assembly towards a dynamic evaporation system with improved performance and salt resistance.","Hu, Yajie;Ma, Hongyun;Wu, Mingmao;Lin, Tengyu;Yao, Houze;Liu, Feng;Cheng, Huhu;Qu, Liangti",10.1038/s41467-022-32051-3,ProQuest
Optimization of Steam Distillation Process and Chemical Constituents of Volatile Oil from <i>Angelicae</i> <i>sinensis</i> Radix,"In this study, the steam distillation process of volatile oil from Angelicae sinensis Radix was optimized according to the concept of quality-by-design. A homemade glass volatile oil extractor was used to achieve better cooling of the volatile oil. First, the soaking time, distillation time, and liquid–material ratio were identified as potential critical process parameters by consulting the literature. Then, the three parameters were investigated by single factor experiments. The volatile oil yield increased with the extension in the distillation time, and first increased and then decreased with the increase in soaking time and liquid–material ratio. The results confirmed that soaking time, distillation time, and liquid–material ratio were all critical process parameters. The kinetics models of volatile oil distillation from Angelicae sinensis Radix were established. The diffusion model of spherical particle was found to be the best model and indicated that the major resistance of mass transfer was the diffusion of volatile oil from the inside to the surface of the medicinal herb. Furthermore, the Box–Behnken experimental design was used to study the relationship between the three parameters and volatile oil yield. A second-order polynomial model was established, with R2 exceeding 0.99. The design space of the volatile oil yield was calculated by a probability-based method. In the verification experiments, the average volatile oil yield reached 0.711%. The results showed that the model was accurate and the design space was reliable. In this study, 21 chemical constituents of volatile oil from Angelicae sinensis Radix were identified by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer(GC-MS), accounting for 99.4% of the total volatile oil. It was found that the content of Z-ligustilide was the highest, accounting for 85.4%.","Wan, Na;Lan, Jing;Wu, Zhenfeng;Chen, Xinying;Zheng, Qin;Gong, Xingchu",10.3390/separations9060137,ProQuest
Numerical Simulation Study on Flow Heat Transfer and Stress Distribution of Shell-and-Tube Superheater in Molten Salt Solar Thermal Power Station,"The flow heat transfer and stress distribution of the shell and tube superheater of the steam generation system in a 50 MW molten salt tank solar thermal power station are studied by numerical simulation, and the influence of the flow pattern of molten salt and water vapor in the shell-and-tube superheater on the heat transfer efficiency and stress distribution under the heat–fluid–solid coupling condition is deeply studied. When the water vapor is located on the tube side of the superheater, the molten salt is located on the shell side, and the counterflow is used in the superheater, the water vapor outlet meets the inlet temperature of the steam turbine, and the heat exchange efficiency of the superheater can reach 94.2%. The optimum inlet temperatures of molten salt and steam in the superheater are 563 and 345 °C, respectively, and the optimum flow rate of molten salt at the inlet of the superheater is 2.5 m/s. Compared with the stable condition, the heat exchange efficiency can be increased by 2.9%, the equivalent stress value is reduced from 335.63 to 312.60 MPa, and the deformation is reduced by 0.48 mm.","Zeng, Yong;Cui, Guangyao;Wu, Wangsong;Xu, Canjun;Huang, Jing;Wang, Jiaming;Yang, Zhongqing",10.3390/pr10051003,ProQuest

In situ synthesizing C‐CuO composite for efficient photo‐thermal conversion and its application in solar‐driven interfacial evaporation,"In this work, we in situ synthesized C‐CuO composite by a facile solid phase grinding for efficient photo‐thermal conversion. Moreover, surface morphology, hydrophilicity property, light absorption characteristic, and evaporation performance were investigated on C‐CuO membrane. It can be seen that C‐CuO composite was well dispersed on the membrane, prompting light harvesting and intentionally encouraging water evaporation. The surface hydrophilicity assisted valid water flow by the membrane toward the heat localization zone and smooth steam escape. At a calcination temperature of 250°C and a mass ratio of 1:1 regarding the preparation of C‐CuO composite, surface temperature of C‐CuO membrane reached to the maximum value around 87.4°C, noticeably stimulating the conversion of water to vapor. Further, the evaporation system with 0.015 g C‐CuO composite loading possessed top‐quality evaporation performance with superior recyclability, which mirrored to 92.6% evaporation efficiency and 1.34 kg m −2 hours −1 evaporation rate after 30 minutes exposure to light, respectively. Our work suggested that in situ synthesized C‐CuO composite was regarded as a potential alternative for clean water production by solar‐driven interfacial evaporation.","Cao, Hongxia;Jiao, Shaokai;Zhang, Sai;Xu, Jigui;Wang, Hongyan;Guo, Chenglong",10.1002/er.6367,ProQuest

Analysis of teachers’ difficulties in implementing STEM approach in learning: a study literature,"STEM approach in learning is applicable in the 21st century in which it promotes 4C skills: communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. The implementation of STEM increases the productivity of the learning process in responding to the challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0. Because it is relatively new in Indonesia, the application of the STEM approach in learning has certain difficulties for teachers. This study aims to determine the difficulties faced by Indonesian mathematics and science teachers in implementing STEM in recent five years. Based on seven main articles compared in this study, the difficulties faced by teachers in implementing STEM or STEAM are varied depending on its main focus (mathematics or science). The most common obstacle faced by mathematics teachers are finding real-life contexts of abstract topic in mathematics. While, the main difficulty experienced by science teachers are insufficient comprehension toward STEM and the limitation of time. Moreover, both mathematics and science teachers shared common difficulties as follows: low understanding about STEM, the lack of facilities and limited time provided in learning schedule. Therefore, to overcome teachers’ difficulties mentioned before, several solutions are offered depends on the needs such as increasing teachers’ comprehension toward STEM, completing school facilities and adjusting curriculum targets under the implementation of STEM.","Diana, N;Turmudi;Yohannes",10.1088/1742-6596/1806/1/012219,ProQuest

Using design thinking to cultivate the next generation of female STEAM thinkers,"Background Countries around the world have struggled to implement education policies and practices to encourage more female youths to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This has resulted in a persistent and sizeable gender gap in science and mathematics subjects in some countries. Using mixed-methods sequential explanatory design, this paper explores an educational intervention—specifically, a 3-day design thinking workshop—in Japan, designed to change female youths’ perceptions regarding STEM topics. Framed using a constructivist approach to learning, the workshops aimed to engender creative confidence, empathy, and global competence among youths. Results The findings show that female youths who participated in the workshop had increased interest in engineering, greater creative confidence, more positive perceptions of STEM, higher levels of empathy and pro-social factors, and a more varied outlook on career options. We argue that this short intervention had a strong influence on the female youths’ mindsets, self-images, and perceptions of STEM. Conclusion This study provides empirical support that a short intervention can produce positive change in how female youths relate to STEM. In gendered societies, an innovative method like design thinking has the potential to revitalize education curriculum in ways that spur female youths’ confidence and creativity, enabling them to imagine a career in the field of STEM.","Kijima Rie;Yang-Yoshihara, Mariko;Maekawa, Marcos Sadao",10.1186/s40594-021-00271-6,ProQuest
Alkali metal modified iron‐nickel oxygen carrier to produce hydrogen‐rich synthesis gas by chemical looping gasification with pine sawdust,"In the research of biomass chemical looping gasification technology, the production of hydrogen‐rich synthesis gas has received increasing attention. In this paper, iron‐nickel oxygen carriers were prepared by the mechanical and impregnation method. Chemical looping gasification experiments were performed with pine sawdust in a self‐built fixed‐bed reactor to prepare hydrogen‐rich synthesis gas. Experimental results showed that for the iron‐nickel oxygen carrier with a loading ratio of 3% NiO under reaction conditions of 800°C, ratio of steam content to biomass (S/B) of 1.25, and ratio of lattice oxygen to biomass (O/B) of 0.2, the volume fraction of hydrogen in the synthesized gas reached 43.06%; correspondingly, the carbon conversion rate was 78.22%, the low calorific value of syngas was 7.49 MJ/Nm 3 , and the gas production rate was 1.25 Nm 3 /kg. After modification of the iron‐nickel oxygen carrier with a mass ratio of 5% K 2 CO 3 , the volume fraction of hydrogen in the prepared synthesis gas increased to 47.83%, the corresponding carbon conversion rate was 85.44%, and the low‐level calorific value was 7.95 MJ/Nm 3 .

Pencil‐traced‐graphite on cellulose: A rapid and solvent‐less approach for solar steam generation,"Solar steam generation has proven to be a sustainable method to handle water shortage. Various materials for solar steam generation have been introduced in the past few years. However, the utilization of tedious and complicated synthesis to generate a photoactive layer is a matter of concern in the fabrication solar steam generation devices. Thus, improved methods toward cost‐effectiveness by exploring economical materials with simple manufacturing process are urgently and essentially needed. In this study, we first report on manufacturing hybrid membranes using commercially accessible materials, that is, cellulose paper and pencil graphite. The proposed method is to trace and coat a cellulose paper directly with a pencil without the use of solvents and chemicals, and it is possible to create an ecofriendly photoactive layer without a complicated process. The formed pencil graphite‐traced membranes were successfully utilized in solar steam generation and showed excellent steam generation rate of 4.32 kg/m 2 h which is almost 3.5 times more than that of pristine membrane at solar intensity of 3 Sun. The developed method could be widely utilized in the field of solar steam generation, since it is very facile and simple, and can be integrated to other commonly used materials for solar steam generation such as fabric and wood. In addition, on‐site production is possible, so it has a potential to be utilized in remote and resource‐limited areas for steam generation.","Muhammad Zakria Tariq;Hanif, Zahid;La, Moonwoo;Choi, Dongwhi;Sung Jea Park",10.1002/er.6219,ProQuest
Exploring the effectiveness of STEAM design processes on middle school students’ creativity,"Creativity has an important role in many scientific processes which constitute a large and complex structure. It is difficult to identify and measure. Students’ creativity can be enhanced through specific education programs. The aim of this study was to develop a science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics (STEAM) design process program for teaching 7th grade middle school students to enhance their verbal and figural creativity. The study lasted 11&#xa0;weeks. Pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental method with a nonequivalent control group was used.

Making Space: Teacher Perceptions of How Participation and Choice Are Mediated within Maker Education in Independent Schools,"While previous research of maker spaces has primarily been focused on public and community spaces, this dissertation looked at maker education in independent schools. Maker education often challenges traditional approaches to teaching and learning, positioning teachers more as facilitators who support students to make meaningful decisions as they realize their big ideas. In examining whether maker education is one way for independent schools to create more inclusive educational settings, this dissertation paid close attention to the pedagogical moves of maker education teachers. In order to conceptualize the power dynamics that influence the teaching and learning within maker education, this study used the construct of third space to explore pedagogical forms of power. Choice and participation are both factors that influence where power lies in a classroom. To better understand the mediating factors of choice and participation, this study used a qualitative approach to examine 17 different teachers’ perceptions of choice and participation within maker education in independent schools. This study also explored how the limitations of COVID-19 impacted the work maker education teachers did with their students. An analysis of the interviews explored how maker teachers’ practices and pedagogical moves make space for student choice and agency. The findings revealed that teacher autonomy enabled the teachers to lift up multiple ways of knowing and gave them a freedom from assigning grades, allowing them to rethink how students were assessed. The teachers’ perceptions of their approach to teaching also appeared aligned with several culturally responsive teaching (CRT) practices, positioning maker education with the potential to renegotiate what is considered legitimate knowledge and providing independent schools with one way to create more inclusive settings. An analysis of findings related to the impacts of COVID-19 revealed that teachers were able to identify several opportunities as a result of COVID-19 limitations. Having fewer materials available proved to be beneficial, time became more expansive. and students’ learning was better connected to their home-based experience. The experiences that maker education teachers described facilitating during COVID-19 present the option to do things differently when students return to in-person learning.","Bird, Kelly",,ProQuest

"A Scalable Prototype by In Situ Polymerization of Biodegradables, Cross-Linked Molecular Mode of Vapor Transport, and Metal Ion Rejection for Solar-Driven Seawater Desalination","Water scarcity in mass populated areas has become a major global threat to the survival and sustainability of community life on earth, which needs the prompt attention of technological leadership. Solar evaporation has emerged as a renewable energy resource and a novel technique for clean water production and wastewater treatment. Indeed, mounting a scalable solar evaporator including high evaporation efficiency and thermal management remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a self-floatable, ecofriendly polypyrrole/wood sponge-based (PPy@WS) steam generator. The low-cost and easy to fabricate evaporator system consists of a single-step in situ polymerization of a 2-D (two-dimensional) hydrophilic wood sponge abundantly available for commercialization. The as-prepared PPy@WS solar evaporator exhibits excellent wettability and is super hydrophilic (contact angle ∼ 0), salt-resistant, and has an excellent light absorption of ∼94% due to omnidirectional diffusion reflection in PPy Nanoparticles (NPs). The capacity of the PPy@WS evaporator to absorb broadband solar radiation and convert it into thermal energy has enabled it to achieve excellent surface temperature (38.6 °C). The accumulated heat can generate vapors at the rate of 1.62 kg·m −2 ·h −1 along with 93% photothermal conversion efficiency under one sun (1 kW·m −2 ). Moreover, the presented prototype possesses the capability to be installed directly without the use of any complex protocol to purify seawater or sewage with an efficient rejection ratio of primary metal ions present in seawater (approximately 100%). This simple fabrication process with renewable polymer resources and photothermal materials can serve as a practical model towards high-performance solar evaporation technology for water-stressed communities in remote areas.","Zhou, Wei;Arshad, Naila;Muhammad Sultan Irshad;Idrees, Muhammad;Ahmed, Iftikhar;Li, Hongrong;Hummad Habib Qazi;Yousaf, Muhammad;Lina Abdullah Alshahrani;Lu, Yuzheng",10.3390/cryst11121489,ProQuest
Implementation of a Playful Microproject Based on Traditional Games for Working on Mathematical and Scientific Content,"According to previous research, we consider it necessary to extend the use of games, as mediating elements, in the learning of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) contents rejected by many students. For this, we have carried out an educational research project on games, with an ethnomathematical approach, since games are an important cultural sign with mathematical and scientific potentialities. We have prepared an anthropological study and an analytical one, generating a catalogue of games from different cultures. Thus, we have verified that, starting with culture, we can get to the game, but we posed the query as to whether, starting from certain games, we could achieve enculturation, by activating mathematical and scientific content in the players. To answer this query, we have created a curricular design called ""playful microproject"" with three traditional games from different cultures and geographical contexts. The microproject was implemented with 32 participants, from 8 to 12 years old. To analyse the results of the microproject, a case study was carried out using qualitative methodology. As part of the playful microproject, the necessary materials for each game were made by hand, and the games were then played. Both the realization of the games and the act of playing showed evidence of mathematical and scientific content, although more in the act of playing. The results revealed that: (1) the three games mobilized 21 categories of analysis, made up of scientific-mathematical content; (2) the three games proved to be equivalent in strong didactic potential; (3) that the microproject provides a valuable intercultural educational approach. The contents evidenced constitute a fundamental part of the Primary Education curriculum: classify, organize, measure, and quantify items, as well as formulate hypotheses, draw conclusions, place oneself in space, and design strategies, among others. It is concluded that these games can promote scientific-mathematical enculturation in a contextualized way.","Fernández-Oliveras, Alicia;Espigares-Gámez, María José;Oliveras, María Luisa",,ProQuest
Low-Cost Astrophotography with a Smartphone: STEAM in Action,"Astrophotography has been responsible for the discovery of planets, solar systems, stars, and several other celestial objects, which directly helps with expanding our knowledge about the universe and creating scientific models for nature. Practical techniques have been extensively described, including Covington, who has published an extensive guide to amateur astrophotography. Furthermore, aiming to introduce such important scientific activity among students, several authors have described possibilities of using the technique in physics and astronomy teaching. However, the proposed activities and methods normally need expensive equipment, such as telescopes, professional cameras, mounts, tripods, optical components, and other items not commonly owned by teachers, students, or the general public. The ubiquity of the smartphone, especially among students, makes it interesting for educational purposes. The device can be used as a mobile laboratory due to the several integrated sensors. Furthermore, the possible uses in classroom are extensive, including the ones involving astronomical subjects, especially with the use of its camera for sky imaging. In this work, we propose a simple and low-cost technique for the practice of astrophotography using the smartphone. Moreover, we suggest teaching activities involving the STEAM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math), including the analysis of the Earth's rotation and the artistic treatment of the astrophotographs.","Paula, Marcos Emanuel;Micha, Daniel Neves",10.1119/5.0019345,ProQuest
The Culture of Disciplines: Reconceptualising Multi-Subject Curricula,"The arts are recognised for their potential to humanise and enrich educational experience, but hold a lowly position in the hierarchy of school subject-based curricula. This limits the time, and thus the influence, they can have. Whilst schools welcome the idea of a curriculum rich with both arts and science subjects, resistance to realising this is often advanced in terms of the proportion of curriculum time required for different subjects. Arguments for STEAM education, whilst apparently challenging this and valuing the potential of the arts, have reinforced its servant role. Drawing on research into a particular project, where the perspectives of the arts and sciences inform and enrich how the other is experienced and understood, we reframe this problem. Firstly, drawing on Massey's conception of space-time, we argue that one can conceive of more than one subject occupying the same curricular space on a school timetable. Secondly, informed by Geertz, we consider what the culture of the arts and the sciences offers, suggesting that this appears to reflect what teachers have valued. We argue that foregrounding the culture of school subjects, and particularly the culture of the arts, as part of a multicultural frame can facilitate rich and engaging educational experiences. Rather than being positioned as competing for time or status in the curriculum, a focus on culture emphasises how the co-existence and interplay of multiple subjects broadens, develops and thus enriches children's educational experience. It also enables a different conception of, and thus role for, the arts in schooling.","Davies, Richard;Trowsdale, Jo",10.1002/berj.3735,ProQuest

Where in the World? A Mars Rover Globally Collaborative STEAM Project,"When people were forced to isolate themselves physically during the pandemic, many new connections sprung up through the Internet. In order to promote this newfound global oneness and to facilitate global education, this article examines a STEAM activity that promotes a holistic approach to education and make way for a global citizenry as students and educators collaborate to discover solutions to the most pressing worldwide issues. This activity was undertaken by a fifth-grade teacher in Houston, Texas, working with a group of about eight students and their teacher from a school in Sao Paolo, Brazil. The students in the United States were working on a unit about matter and identifying materials through observations and measurements. A focus on engineering practices facilitated the global collaboration. The mission was to build a rover that will be able to travel on Mars. The activity was executed remotely with the goal of promoting a shared collaborative partnership between the American and Brazilian teams. The teams from two different locales need to share ideas to make a prototype that will travel for at least one meter. The object is for them to create the same rover within each group through their discourse. To further encourage cultural exchange and promote ecofriendly and affordable construction, they were encouraged to use recyclable materials. The activity can be adapted to different grades and places, depending on the teacher's preference and location of the international partnership.","Iqbal, Shazia;Miller, Jocelyn;Smith, Walter",,ProQuest
Integrating Arts with STEM to Foster Systems Thinking,"Interest is growing among out-of-school time (OST) educators in integrating the arts into STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) programming (e.g., Kelton &amp; Saraniero, 2018). Arts-integrated STEM--or STEAM--programming now takes place in a wide variety of OST environments, from relatively institutional learning settings, such as a library, to emergent or fluid settings, such as a pop-up program in a housing development community room. Educators often consider OST environments to be conducive to creative and conceptually ambitious STEAM programming because these spaces have the potential to deconstruct rigid boundaries between disciplines that formal education often reinforces. In this article, the authors discuss an OST STEAM program titled Zoom! that they designed and implemented in a summer camp in July 2019. Zoom! used visual arts strategies to support elementary-aged children in thinking about and communicating systems-level ideas related to the human microbiome--the community of single-celled organisms that live on and inside the human body.","Grace, Elizabeth;Kelton, Molly L.;Owen, Jeb P.;Diaz Martinez, AnaMaria;White, Alison;Danielson, Robert W.;Butterfield, Patricia;Fallon, Michaela;Schafer Medina, Georgia",,ProQuest
The Emerging Critical Pedagogies of Dance Educators in an Urban STEAM After-School Program for Black Girls,"The preparation of urban educators has gained widespread attention across education policy, research, and practice. As US urban cities have become more diverse, the teacher workforce has not kept up, and the racial/ethnic demographics of students and teachers are disproportionately incongruent. In order to eradicate an education landscape that perpetuates white, middle-class ways of knowing and being, often at the expense of the cultural practices and cultural wealth of historically marginalized students of color, urban teacher education must be centered toward justice and rooted in critical pedagogies. The literature, albeit bleak, reveals that these perspectives must also be applied to urban dance education. Dance education programs have been significantly eliminated from urban schools over time, and although dance has historical roots in African and African diasporic cultures, dance education continues to be Eurocentric. This phenomenological case study examines the emerging critical pedagogies of undergraduate dance majors and minors who served as dance teachers in an urban Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) after-school program for 7-12-year-old Black girls. Findings reveal that (a) navigating race, place, and space; (b) mentorship and practice; and (c) critical reflection and self-efficacy were critical components of the urban dance educators' emerging critical pedagogies. Implications for urban dance education and the broader field of urban education are provided.","Allen-Handy, Ayana;Ifill, Valerie;Schaar, Raja Y.;Woodard, Monique;Rogers, Michelle",,ProQuest
A Pandemic as the Mother of Invention? Collegial Online Collaboration to Cope with the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This article aims to present how music teachers in Sweden used the facebook group ""Musiklärarna"" in the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March and April, 2020) to cope with challenges related to teaching music. The study is based on Biesta's perspective on the teacher profession. With the consent of the participants, we have analysed the 303 posts (and their comments) that directly addressed the COVID-19 situation during that period. We found that the group works as an important collegial forum and that the teachers pragmatically use the group to solve educational problems; further, the posts concerning work-conditions get the most engagement. The most frequent types of posts concerned how to design teaching situations under the new conditions. Specifically, ""asking questions,"" ""sharing material,"" ""asking for material"" and ""letting off steam"" were the most common types. Music teachers seem to be loyal, collegial and intent on solving any challenge to facilitate students' learning as regulated in the syllabus. We hope this article can motivate other researchers to perform similar studies or build on our results. We conclude by speculating about what the new normal will be for music teachers when the pandemic is over.","Thorgersen, Ketil A.;Mars, Annette",10.1080/14613808.2021.1906216,ProQuest
"Making on the Move: Mobility, Makerspaces, and Art Education","Combining the excitement from the maker movement and the novel creation of deployable makerspaces, we review the development of the Mobile Atelier for Kinaesthetic Education (MAKE) 3D.

Simulation and Evaluation of Heat Transfer Inside a Diseased Citrus Tree during Heat Treatment,"Heat treatment has been applied in previous studies to treat diseased plants and trees affected by heat-sensitive pathogens. Huanglongbing (HLB) is a heat-sensitive pathogen and the optimal temperature–time for treating HLB-affected citrus trees was estimated to be 54 °C for 60 to 120 s from indoor experimental studies. However, utilizing this method in orchards is difficult due to technical difficulties to effectively apply heat. Recently, a mobile thermotherapy system (MTS) was developed to in-field treat HLB-affected trees. This mobile device includes a canopy cover that covers the diseased tree and a system to supply steam under the cover to treat the tree. It was proven that the temperature inside the canopy cover can reach the desired one (i.e., 54 °C) to kill bacteria. However, for HLB, the heat should penetrate the tree’s phloem where the bacteria live. Therefore, measuring the heat penetration inside the tree is very critical to evaluate the performance of the MTS. In this study, a heat transfer model was developed to simulate the heat penetration inside the tree and predict the temperature in the phloem of the diseased tree during the in-field heat treatment. The simulation results were compared with in-field experimental measurements. The heat transfer model was developed by a comparative analysis of the experimental data using the ANSYS software. Results showed that the temperature in the phloem was 10–40% lower than the temperature near the surface of the bark. Simulation results were consistent with experimental results, with an average relative error of less than 5%.","Ghatrehsamani, Shirin;Ampatzidis, Yiannis;Schueller, John K;Ehsani, Reza",10.3390/agriengineering3010002,ProQuest

The framework of the cultural teaching is storytelling and relationships. Cultural perspectives in astronomy such as this remind us of how indigenous ways of knowing are rooted in inclusion, engagement, and relevancy. Designed by A. Lee in 2007, the Native Skywatchers initiative seeks to remember and revitalize indigenous star and earth knowledge, promoting the native voice as the lead voice. The overarching goal of Native Skywatchers is to communicate the knowledge that indigenous people traditionally practiced a sustainable way of living and sustainable engineering through a living and participatory relationship with the above and below, sky and earth. In 2012 two indigenous star maps were created: the Ojibwe Giizhig Anung Masinaaigan-Ojibwe Sky Star Map (A. Lee, W. Wilson, C. Gawboy), and the D(L)akota star map, Makoce Wicanhpi Wowapi (A. Lee, J. Rock). In 2016, a collaboration with W. Buck of the Manitoba First Nations Resource Centre (MFNRC), produced a third star map: Ininew Achakos Masinikan-Cree Star Map Book. We aim to improve current inequities in education for native young people especially through STEM engagement, to inspire increased cultural pride, and promote community wellness. Presented here will be recently created resources such as: astronomical calendar-paintings and short videos that exist at the intersection of art-science-culture. As we look for sustainable ways to widen participation in STEM, particularly in astronomy education, part of the conversation needs to consider the place for art and culture in STEM.","Lee, Annette S;Wilson, William;Tibbetts, Jeff;Gawboy, Carl;Meyer, Anne;Buck, Wilfred;Knutson-Kolodzne, Jim;Pantalony, David",,ProQuest
Astro-animation: A case study of art and science education,"Art and science are different ways of exploring the world, but together they have the potential to be thought-provoking, facilitate a science–society dialogue, raise public awareness of science and develop an understanding of art. For several years, we have been teaching an astro-animation class at the Maryland Institute College of Art as a collaboration between students and NASA scientists. Working in small groups, the students create short animations based on the research of the scientists who are going to follow the projects as mentors. By creating these animations, students bring the power of their imagination to see the research of the scientists through a different lens. Astro-animation is an undergraduate-level course jointly taught by an astrophysicist and an animator. In this article, we present the motivation behind the class, describe the details of how it is carried out and discuss the interactions between artists and scientists. We describe how such a programme offers an effective way for art students, not only to learn about science but to have a glimpse of ‘science in action’. The students have the opportunity to become involved in the process of science as artists, as observers first and potentially through their own art research. Every year, one or more internships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center have been available for our students in the summer. Two students describe their experiences undertaking these internships and how science affects their creation of animations for this programme and in general. We also explain the genesis of our astro-animation programme, how it is taught in our animation department and we present the highlights of an investigation of the effectiveness of this programme we carried out with the support of an NEA research grant. In conclusion, we discuss how the programme may grow in new directions, such as contributing to informal STE(A)M learning.",[AUTHOR]Arcadias Laurence[/AUTHOR][ORCID]0000-0002-5062-0238[/ORCID][AUTHOR]Corbet Robin H.

Reduced Graphene Oxide–Based Spectrally Selective Absorber with an Extremely Low Thermal Emittance and High Solar Absorptance,"Carbon‐based black materials exhibit strong solar absorptance (α solar &gt;0.90), which play key roles in transforming solar energy into available power for solar‐thermal, thermophotovoltaic, thermoelectric, and many other systems. However, because of high thermal emittance (&gt;95%), these carbon‐based materials always cause huge energy loss that hinders the solar‐thermal conversion efficiency tremendously. In this study, a reduced graphene oxide–based spectrally selective absorber (rGO‐SSA) is demonstrated, which possesses a recorded low thermal emittance (≈4%) and high solar absorptance (α solar ≈ 0.92) by easily regulating the reduction level of inner 2D graphene sheets. Compared to conventional carbon‐based black materials, thermal emittance of this rGO‐SSA is largely reduced by ≈95.8% and the cutoff wavelength of rGO‐SSA is broadband‐tunable that can range from 1.1 to 3.2 µm. More importantly, this simply sol‐gel coated rGO‐SSA has high temperature tolerance at 800 °C for 96 h that is hardly achieved by other cermet‐based or photonic‐based SSAs. Based on this rGO‐SSA, ultrafast solar steam escape (0.94 mg cm −2 s −1 ) under concentrated solar irradiance is achieved directly. The insight from this study will provide a new strategy for constructing thermally stable carbon‐based SSAs and greatly facilitate the solar‐thermal practical significance.","Liao, Qihua;Zhang, Panpan;Houze Yao;Cheng, Huhu;Li, Chun;Qu, Liangti",10.1002/advs.201903125,ProQuest

Dynamic characteristics of a solar‐aided coal‐fired power generation system under direct normal irradiance (DNI) feedforward control,"A solar‐aided coal‐fired power generation (SAPG) system is a new type of power generation system in the field of solar thermal power generation. However, the instability of solar radiation will cause fluctuations in steam temperature, which is unfavorable for the operation of boilers and steam turbines. Based on a 600&#xa0;MW subcritical coal‐fired power generation unit, TRNSYS software is applied to establish a transient simulation model of SAPG in this paper. A dynamic feedforward control system for steam temperature is set up. Some essential parameters, such as the fuel consumption rate, solar‐heated steam extraction rate, water spraying flow rate, and flue gas damper opening, are under the control of direct normal irradiance (DNI). Then, the dynamic characteristics of SAPG are analyzed using typical weather data. The simulation results show that under the fuel‐saving mode, when solar irradiation changes, the SAPG system achieves a coal reduction of 4.9% by using the steam temperature control system with DNI feedforward control, and the main steam temperature fluctuation is less than 5°C with the reheat steam temperature reduced within a reasonable range. The power generation fluctuation is less than 10&#xa0;MW, and the solar‐to‐electricity efficiency reaches 22.5%. Some parameters on both the flue gas side and the water/steam side in the utility boiler are simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of DNI control.","Pang, Liping;Lv, Peixin;Duan, Liqiang;Yang, Yongping",10.1002/ese3.592,ProQuest
Effectiveness of Maltodextrin as a Coating in Microencapsulation of Clove Leaves Oil (<i>Syzygium aromaticum</i>) for Antibacterial Applications,"Clove leaves oil is potential oil used as antibacterial such as Escherichia coli . However, clove leaves oil has several disadvantages, including being easily oxidized and volatile. In order to overcome this problem a microencapsulation process is carried out. The purpose of this study was to test the ability of clove leaves oil and the results of microencapsulation as an antibacterial E. coli. Clove leaves oil was isolated using water-steam distillation. Furthermore, the obtained essential oil was microcapsulated by spray-drying method. Microencapsulation results were characterized using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) to determine the morphology of the produced material. The SEM results indicate that the resulting microcapsules are rounded shape, which shows that the formed microcapsules have not fully developed. The results of the activity test by using clove leaves oil as an antibacterial E. coli denoted a inhibitory zone diameter was 15.2 mm, while the oil was microencapsulated with a coating ratio of 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10, 1:12 produces inhibitory zones 9.9; 11.3; 12.9; 14.8 and 17.5 mm, respectively. Results of statistical tests indicate that antibacterial activity of clove leaves oil is 100 % significantly different from the comparative microencapsulation activity 1:4 with t value = 11.30&gt;t tab = 9.93. Ratio microcapsul 1:6; 1:8; 1:10 and 1:12 having activities that were no different from clove leaves oil 100% and were showed by t value 8.65; 4.25; 0.76; 2.62, respectively &lt; t tab = 9.93 on the confidence level α = 0,01; df =2. Thus it can be stated that minimum ratio of maltodextrin to clove leaves oil that can be used as a coating is a microcapsule ratio of 1: 6.","Nurliana, L;Kurniawati, D;LA Kadir;Dewi, F;Musta, R;Nurjana",10.1088/1755-1315/465/1/012040,ProQuest
The Rise of 2D Photothermal Materials beyond Graphene for Clean Water Production,"Water shortage is one of the most concerning global challenges in the 21st century. Solar‐inspired vaporization employing photothermal nanomaterials is considered to be a feasible and green technology for addressing the water challenge by virtue of abundant and clean solar energy. 2D nanomaterials aroused considerable attention in photothermal evaporation‐induced water production owing to their large absorption surface, strong absorption in broadband solar spectrum, and efficient photothermal conversion. Herein, the recent progress of 2D nanomaterials‐based photothermal evaporation, mainly including emerging Xenes (phosphorene, antimonene, tellurene, and borophene) and binary‐enes (MXenes and transition metal dichalcogenides), is reviewed. Then, the optimization strategies for higher evaporation performance are summarized in terms of modulation of the intrinsic photothermal performance of 2D nanomaterials and design of the complete evaporation system. Finally, the challenges and prospective of various kinds of 2D photothermal nanomaterials are discussed in terms of the photothermal performance, stability, environmental influence, and cost. One important principle is that solutions for water challenges should not introduce new environmental and social problems. This Review aims to highlight the role of 2D photothermal nanomaterials in solving water challenges and provides a viable scheme toward the practical use in photothermal materials selection, design, and evaporation systems building.","Xie, Zhongjian;Yanhong Duo;Lin, Zhitao;Fan, Taojian;Xing, Chenyang;Li, Yu;Wang, Renheng;Qiu, Meng;Zhang, Yupeng;Zhao, Yonghua;Yan, Xiaobing;Zhang, Han",,ProQuest
Optimizing the preparation of Ni‐Ce‐Pr catalysts for efficient hydrogen production by n‐dodecane steam reforming,"Nowadays, the development of fuel cell is getting more and more inseparable from the production of hydrogen. Long‐chain hydrocarbons steam reforming is a feasible way for hydrogen supply. Herein, various nickel‐ceria‐praseodymium (Ni‐Ce‐Pr) catalysts have been prepared by a sol‐gel method. Multiple parameters during catalyst preparation, including the amount of Ni, the content of doped Pr and the calcination temperature, were systematically studied for tuning the catalytic performance for n ‐dodecane steam reforming in a fixed‐bed reactor under 15 mL/g cat ·h at 600°C and water‐to‐carbon molar ratio of 2 at 0.1 MPa. Reaction data showed that both the amount of Ni and the content of doped Pr will greatly affect the n ‐dodecane conversion and hydrogen production. Additionally, the calcination temperature during catalyst preparation showed a big influence on its performance for n ‐dodecane steam reforming. After optimization, 10Ni‐CePr 2 ‐600 exhibits the highest activity and stability for n ‐dodecane steam reforming, accompanying with the lowest rate of coke deposition (0.015 g c /g cat ·h). The structure and oxygen vacancy of the catalyst was characterized by H 2 ‐TPR, Raman, and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The superior activity and stability of 10Ni‐CePr 2 ‐600 are ascribed to the strong interaction between NiO and support along with abundant oxygen vacancies in the Pr‐doped ceria.","Xiao, Zhourong;Zhang, Xiangwen;Wang, Li;Li, Guozhu",10.1002/er.5029,ProQuest
Reviving the William Liddell Damask Design Collection,"The William Liddell archive is a collection of over 1600 glass photographic plates recovered from the premises of the abandoned Ewart-Liddell weaving factory in Donaghcloney, County Down, Northern Ireland. The salvaged collection was donated to the Belfast School of Art in 2007; however, the condition was so fragile that they have not been able to be accessed or used. Heritage Lottery Funding was secured in 2017 to make this unique archive accessible to the public and to support a series of local road shows culminating in an exhibition in Autumn 2018 in the Linen Centre, Lisburn Museum. This paper reports on preliminary findings after the careful digitization and cataloguing of each plate. The plates appear to have been kept as a record of the working methods of designers and technical draughtsmen and draughtswomen in the company dating from the early twentieth century to 1970s. The sketches, designs, and technical drawings recorded were used for the production of Jacquard Damask linen for tableware, bed linen and furnishings. The collection evidences a tantalizing clientele that was worldwide. William Liddell produced high quality Damask linen products for clients across the globe, top hotels such as the Hilton, Savoy, Raffles and the Ritz; shipping lines such as Cunard, White Star, and the Union Steam Navigation Company of New Zealand; organizations such as the U.S. Navy, the Bohemian Club San Francisco, Canadian Coastguards and Claridges. The photographs document design specifications from Liddell's clients, early sketches, painted drawings, accurately hand-drafted designs and typography, point paper layouts, and proof cloths. It is extraordinary that this form of unique photographic record was kept and perhaps more astonishing that the observation of everyday affairs of a textile manufacturing design office were the subjects of such an extensive and persistent documentary endeavor. This paper reports on the preliminary findings of the study, the approaches used to classify and cross-reference the archive's content and outlines the present categories being used in terms of client markets, design influences, and stages of the Damask design process.","Dass, Barbara;Belford, Patricia",10.1080/20511787.2019.1598716,ProQuest
The Story of 13 Moons: Developing an Environmental Health and Sustainability Curriculum Founded on Indigenous First Foods and Technologies,"The Swinomish Indian Tribal Community developed an informal environmental health and sustainability (EHS) curriculum based on Swinomish beliefs and practices. EHS programs developed and implemented by Indigenous communities are extremely scarce. The mainstream view of EHS does not do justice to how many Indigenous peoples define EHS as reciprocal relationships between people, nonhuman beings, homelands, air, and waters. The curriculum provides an alternative informal educational platform for teaching science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) using identification, harvest, and preparation activities of First Foods and medicines that are important to community members in order to increase awareness and understanding of local EHS issues. The curriculum, called 13 Moons, is founded on a set of guiding principles which may be useful for other Indigenous communities seeking to develop their own curricula.","Donatuto, Jamie;Campbell, Larry;LeCompte, Joyce K;Rohlman, Diana;Tadlock, Sonni",10.3390/su12218913,ProQuest

Cases on Models and Methods for STEAM Education. Advances in Educational Technologies and Instructional Design (AETID) Book Series,"STEAM education can be described in two ways. One model emphasizes the arts and is not as concerned about the accuracy of the STEM fields. In the second model, STEM content is the prevailing force with a focus on accuracy, and the arts are used in limited and secondary resources for the teaching of the content. However, in order to promote creative thinking, allow for higher student engagement, and offer a more well-rounded education, a STEAM model, where science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics are equal contributors to the process of learning, is needed. ""Cases on Models and Methods for STEAM Education"" is an important scholarly resource that provides inclusive models and case studies highlighting best techniques and practices for implementing STEAM models in teaching and assists teachers as they learn to use such methods through the inclusion of practical activities for use in the classroom.

Geothermal power generation in China: Status and prospects,"Geothermal resources provide green, low‐carbon, and renewable clean energy, with abundant reserves and massive potential for application. The in‐depth analysis of geothermal resources in China, including their distribution and breakdown by shallow, hydrothermal, and hot dry rock (HDR) resources, is made in this study. Using the recent economic reports and state‐of‐the‐art technological solutions, this survey outlines the latest trends in the geothermal power generation in China. The application of geothermal power generation in China is still at an early stage, with the total installed capacity of 27.78&#xa0;MW. The geothermal power generation technologies, such as dry steam technology, flash technology, binary cycle technology, and enhanced geothermal system (EGS), are briefly discussed and linked to their lucrative implementation sites. In particular, Tibet's Yangbajing is considered to be the most lucrative site for the EGS pilot project. The comparative analysis of low‐cost/large‐scale geothermal power generation technologies, such as low‐ to medium‐temperature one, solar‐geothermal hybrid one, and geothermal power generation in mines, was made, whose results strongly indicated the EGS technical and economical advantages. The concentration of 96% of China's population in the area to the east of Hu line affects the perspectives of high‐cost geothermal projects and has to be accounted in the comprehensive analysis of available data. Based on the revealed trends of geothermal resources’ development in China, the following guidelines are strongly recommended: comprehensive incorporation of geothermal energy generation into China's national energy and climate improvement plans, the rapid implementation of HDR technology, as well as comprehensive adaptation of the geothermal‐related projects to the local conditions/biased distribution of power consumers and state‐of‐the‐art challenges of power consumption.","Zhang, Lei;Chen, Shuai;Zhang, Cun",10.1002/ese3.365,ProQuest
Heat transfer in coiled type superheater of moisture separator-reheater of turbines at the nuclear power plant,The reheating part of the moisture separator-reheater (MSR) of nuclear power plant (NPP) steam turbine occupies a significant part of MSR volume and requires large consumption of metal. The superheating of low pressure steam provides by the high pressure steam condensation. This steam supplies partly from turbine inlet and partly from turbine stage bleeding because of two superheater stages. The significantly less heat transfer intensity at the single-phase side of reheater comparatively with condensation side requires intensification of heat transfer from the heated-steam. For such goal the different methods can be used: for instance the cross flow of the coiled tubes and finning of straight tubes bundles. Also is perspective the usage of artificial roughness in form of small “moons” and other types of artificial roughnesses.,"Egorov, Mikle;Kalyutik, A A;Akhmetova, I G;SO Makoev",10.1088/1755-1315/288/1/012080,ProQuest
The implementation results of safe bicycle transport in Taipei City,"Background: In 2013, there were 7,016 bicycle accidents, resulting in 62 deaths and 10,162 injuries in Taiwan. Since then, there have been more than 7,000 accidents every year, and the number of accidents in 2017 has reached a peak of 8,106 records for the past five years. Among them, the number of electric bicycle accidents increased the most, with 1,183 compared to 2013 and the number of persons injured also increased by 1,310 whereas the number of bicycle accident from 6,262 to 6,169. Methods: Taipei City creating a friendly, safe and secure urban environment to ride: 1. Bicycle Road Network Deployment: bicycle-exclusive lanes, walkways, bicycle and pedestrian shared path and so on in order to meet a variety of traffic needs. 2. Safe and comprehensive road environment: Set up bike stands, road surfacing, street trees, signs, (pavement) markings, dedicated signs, intersection rotation and other traffic amenities to create a safe and comfortable riding environment. To promote cycling to the station to transfer MRTs is tantamount to encouraging people to take more public transport. 3. Planning a city bicycle rental system: To provide a public rental system to expand the convenience, visibility and the community of users launched a new type of public transport - public bicycle rental system (YouBike). The Youbike started demonstration operation, initially setting up 11 station points and 500 bicycles in the peripheral regions of Xinyi District on March 1 1th, 2009, and now there are 400 station points in all districts. 4. Bicycle Safe Riding Education: Most people refuse to wear helmet protection, and do not install safety devices such as reflectors and warning lights. Causes easy collision at night. The top three reasons for bicycle accidents are not giving way according to regulations, inappropriately making U-turns (turn direction) and Breaching traffic signs and sign controls. Furthermore, wrong-way driving and Careless overstepping are also the main causes of accidents. 5. Smart transportation Setting: To build a safe environment from the appropriate space. Its city area cycle path from 41 kilometers in 2006 (16.4 for dedicated lanes and 24.6 for bicycle and pedestrian shared path) to an extended 391 kilometers in 2018 (86.7 kilometers for dedicated lanes and 304.3 for bicycle and pedestrian shared path). The number of bike stands in Taipei urban area has increased from 5,202 in 2006 to 42,121 in 2018(809%). Appropriately adjust the lane allocation ratio through management means and let the left-turning bicycle turn in a two-stage left turn. This way allows the bicycle to start earlier than the steam locomotive when the green light starts to light up. Results: The implementation results of safe bicycle transport in Taipei City effectively reduced the death and rate caused by head injuries in bicycle accidents: the number of casualties (6,262 dropped to 6,169, down 1.49%), the number of deaths (59 to 30, a drop of 49.15%) or the number of injured persons (9,099 to 8,71 1), all presented a declining trend. Conclusion: Changing car-oriented road planning, complete bicycle infrastructure, and respecting the driving awareness of bicycle users is the best protection for the public. All policies should have comprehensive safety policies to ensure personal safety. Just like separate two types of transport, the overall design of the exclusive separation bicycle road, the policy of forcing all ages riding locomotives to wear helmets, etc. In the future, we will continue to plan for self-defense special road layout, intersection ramp configuration, traffic engineering and parking and transfer facilities, so that all roads in the city are safe and friendly, and we will become the first place for bicycle safety riding. Successful experience is extended to the whole country.","Wu, Yin-Huan;Ching-Ting, Yang;Chen-Chen, Chou;Man-Lin, Chang;Ming-Yu, Hsieh;Yeh-Tzu, Kuo",,ProQuest
Integrating Geothermal Energy Education to an Engineering Technology Curriculum,"The theory and practice of the renewable energy and the sustainability education have been directly and indirectly included as new curriculum materials in many engineering and technology programs. Solar, wind, and Hydrogen fuel cell systems are available green energy technologies supported with customized educational trainers and modules in higher education institutions. Meanwhile other clean and alternative energy technologies such as geothermal heat pumps have steadily become an energy and cost efficient alternate to traditional heating and cooling systems. This require specifically engineering technology students to better gain competencies of geothermal energy for applying industrial, residential, and commercial geothermal systems in design, installation, testing, operating, data acquisition, monitoring and troubleshooting of related geothermal systems. However, due to larger laboratory space requirements, larger physical size and the higher initial cost of geothermal energy applications, many engineering and technology institutions were not able to include them in the curriculum, therefore simulation studies were the mostly an option for students to understand geothermal heat pump design and operation. Geothermal energy is the energy contained as heat in the Earth’s interior layer. The internal structure of the Earth together with the heat transfer mechanisms inside mantle and crust plays a significant role in the geothermal energy applications. Geothermal energy, as natural steam and hot water, has been exploited for decades to generate electricity, and both in space heating and industrial processes in many countries. This paper describes the curriculum enhancement for an existing junior level alternative energy class in a B.S. in Engineering Technology program by adding geothermal energy fundamentals and applications in it. The curriculum includes; (1) the analysis of refrigeration cycle on a pressure-enthalpy diagram using pressures and temperatures measured in a FESTO Didactic geothermal heat pump system, (2) obtaining coefficient performance (COP) and the energy efficiency ratio (EER) of a geothermal heat pump using measured temperature, humidity, voltage, and current values in normal and different loading scenarios for safe and effective operation. National Instrument’s LabVIEWTM software and myDAQ data acquisition module integrated with variety of sensors are also used as modern tools for the instrumentation and interfacing of the geothermal heat pump system that resulted in increased students’ interest to a traditionally mechanical engineering and technology application. This curriculum update serves as a major and minor class for multiple degree concentrations such as ECET, construction management, safety management, and engineering design and development in the department of engineering technology. The university’s recent strong partnership with a major energy services company also makes electrical power and renewable energy curriculum central to the University and College’s strategic planning that will produce future engineering technology graduates ready for implementing renewable energy technologies and applications on their areas of concentrations.","Pecen, Reg;Yildiz, Faruk;Ulan Dakeev",,ProQuest
"A review of the effect of integrated STEM or STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) education in South Korea","Integrated STEAM education in South Korea is an approach to preparing a quality STEM workforce and literate citizens for highly technology-based society. Through a literature review, this study examined the STEAM education initiative in South Korea and investigated its effects on learning and teaching. Studies in South Korea found that teacher professional development courses increased teachers’ recognition of the initiative as well as their confidence in teaching STEAM. Teacher interviews showed that coaching in classroom practices within teachers’ professional development was helpful. Although studies reported that many science teachers adopted STEAM in science teaching, there was a lack of research on how teachers taught STEAM lessons, let alone the connections between teachers’ perceptions of STEAM and their classroom practices. As for STEAM effects on student learning, a number of meta-analyses showed that students’ experiences with STEAM were effective in both cognitive and affective learning. The effect was higher in affective domains. Interviews with college students who had STEAM experiences in grade school showed that the effects could be long-term. The meta-analysis studies failed to identify significant mediating factors, which required further in-depth research on how contextual variables function in student learning. This paper provides a glimpse of what can be achieved through STEAM efforts, and what should be further researched for better theory and practice.","Nam-Hwa, Kang",10.1186/s41029-019-0034-y,ProQuest

The Student-Self Oriented Learning Model as an Effective Paradigm for Education in Knowledge Society,"Proceeding from broadly accepted role of emotional intelligence (EI) in professional and personal life, the paper suggests a new learning model (LM) called Student-Self Oriented LM (SSOL-model). It is defined as the model being beneficial for self-cognition and self-construction through the prism of the acquired knowledge and life experience. Two successful implementations of the SSOL-model are shortly described: the system of emotional-imaginative teaching (the EIT-system) developed by the authors in the 1990s and expanded in the 2000s and art cognitonics. The EIT-system is underpinned by the authors' Theory of Dynamic Conceptual Mappings (the DCM-theory). The EIT-system includes an original method of developing figurative thinking and creativity at the lessons of second language (English for Russian children), literature and poetry in English and Russian, symbolic language of painting, and communication culture. It is stated that this method may be used as an effective starting framework of STEAM education. It is mentioned that the DCM-theory and the EIT-system became the starting point for developing the foundations of a new scientific discipline called cognitonics. The basic principles of art cognitonics - a well developed branch of cognitonics and the concept of cognitive engagement are described. The significance of art cognitonics for helping the learners to answer the encountered moral questions is explained. The broad possibilities of designing intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) of new generation are indicated. These are culture and moral experience oriented systems aimed at developing figurative thinking, creativity, early socialization and helping the students to find in the outstanding art works the answers to emerging moral questions. An original, detailed script of an ITS contributing to early socialization of the learners is described, its literary source is the fairy-tale ""Sleeping Beauty"". Since the sphere of using the SSOL-model is not restricted, it is suggested to interpret this model as an effective paradigm for education in knowledge society and a strong support to anthropocentric approach to education in the digital age.","Fomichov, Vladimir A;Fomichova, Olga S",10.31449/inf.v43i1.2356,ProQuest
Effect of thermotherapy on the acquisition of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus by the Asian citrus psyllid (Hemiptera: Liviidae),"The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is the most detrimental insect pest of citrus crops due to its role as a vector of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), the bacterial causal agent of huanglongbing, also known as citrus greening disease. Trees infected with Las decline rapidly and fruit production decreases until eventual tree death. Few treatment options for infected trees are available for disease management. A technique called ""thermotherapy"" is under development to reduce bacterial titers in infected trees; however, the effect of these treatments on the transmission cycle of Las is not known. Field and laboratory assays were conducted to determine whether thermotherapy treatment reduced Las acquisition by D. citri. Trees in the field were treated with a mobile heat treatment system. Potted trees in the laboratory were treated in a steam chamber. We monitored acquisition rates in D. citri following thermal treatment of Las-positive Citrus sinensis (L.) (Rutaceae). Psyllid acquisition and Las titer in thermotherapy-treated trees were compared with untreated Las-positive and untreated Las-negative trees. Our results confirmed the efficacy of whole-tree thermotherapy on Las in potted citrus trees. In contrast, thermotherapy did not significantly reduce plant Las titers or acquisition of Las by D. citri under field conditions. These results suggest that further development of field application methods is needed to determine the utility of thermotherapy as a tool for huanglongbing management.","Kelley, Alicia J;Pelz-Stelinski, Kirsten S",,ProQuest
Effect of Heat Curing Method on the Mechanical Strength of Alkali-Activated Slag Mortar after High-Temperature Exposure,"The aim of this work was to study the mechanical strength and microstructure changes of alkali-activated slag mortar (AAS mortar) after being heat treated in the temperature range of 200–1000 °C. The AAS mortar was cured in the ambient condition (20 ± 5 °C, 60 ± 5% RH) (Relative humidity: RH) and high temperature condition (80 °C) for 27 days with three different heating regimes: curing in a dry oven, curing in sealed plastic bags, and in a steam environment. The activator for the AAS synthesis was a mixture of sodium silicate solution (water glass) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with a SiO 2 /Na 2 O weight ratio of 1, and a dosage of 4% Na 2 O by slag weight. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) incorporated with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to assess the mortar microstructure change. The results revealed that the curing method significantly affected the mechanical strength of AAS at temperatures lower than 800 °C. The heat treatment at late age of 28 days was more beneficial for compressive strength enhancement in specimens without using heat curing methods.","Tai Thanh Tran;Kang, Hyuk;Hyug-Moon Kwon",10.3390/ma12111789,ProQuest
Relational Epistemologies in Land-Based Learning Environments: Reasoning about Ecological Systems and Spatial Indexing in Motion,"Social and cultural practices in learning settings are sites for leveraging and/or remediating sustainable and just conceptions of nature-culture relations to meet changing environmental demands of twenty-first century. In this study,&#xa0;we examine epistemic navigation among Indigenous youth in an outdoor, land based, STEAM (science, education, arts, math, and science) camp which not only leveraged nature-culture relations as part of critical engagement with socio-ecological systems, but also as a site for Indigenous resurgence and well-being in learning spaces. We&#xa0;take a microethnographic (Gee and Green in Rev Res Educ 23:119-169, 1998. https://doi.org/10.2307/1167289) approach&#xa0;to examine sense-making among three youth while engaged in a walking activity in which they were asked to embody a plant as part of cultural practices of reading the land. We found that the micro-practice of spatial indexing dynamically mediated sense-making about ecological systems as participants coordinated attention and observations between humans and more-than-human kinds. This form of sense making reflected both cultural and historical experiences, which students leveraged in their understandings of complex socio-ecological systems.","Pugh, Priya;McGinty, Megan;Bang, Megan",10.1007/s11422-019-09922-1,ProQuest
STEAM as an Innovative Educational Technology,"The purpose of this work is to develop a model for the construction of STEAM-education, which is based on project training in the so-called ""creative spaces"". ""Creative spaces"" are integration areas of schoolchildren, students and graduate students working in the format of joint work on projects initiated by various structures of a society and business. The authors of the article analyzed the experience of different countries in the implementation of STEM and STEAM-education and identified the effective ways of structuring technical disciplines, art and creative activity into a single integration program. During 2017-2018 years within the framework of informal and nonformal education, an experimental work was carried out with 32 schoolchildren and 34 students, aimed at determining the level of the development of such competences as: the ability to manage projects and processes, system thinking, the ability to art creativity, the ability to work within the teams, groups and individuals, the ability to work in a regime of high uncertainty and a rapid change in the conditions of tasks. Analysis of the results of experimental work has shown that the use of ""creative spaces"" for the implementation of project activities of schoolchildren and students, the inclusion of the category ""art"" in its content allows students to form skills and competencies necessary for the Industry 4.0.","Shatunova, Olga;Anisimova, Tatyana;Sabirova, Fairuza;Kalimullina, Olga",,ProQuest
Music Notes to Amino Acid Sequence: A STEAM Approach to Study Protein Structure,"Recently, manuscripts that use bioinformatics tools to convert proteins and other biological materials into music have appeared in several journals. The authors claim that this type of studies adds joy to education of life sciences and attract public attention to biochemistry education along with other uses. We thought the reverse of the process might also be possible for the purpose. We converted notes into amino acids depending on the decreasing hydrophobicity and by using the famous nursery song ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" notes, a hypothetical protein sequence was obtained. Three-dimensional structures were modeled by I-Tasser Protein Structure and Function Prediction server and the structure of the possible models were investigated. This Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) approach may bring fun to protein structure education.","Acan, Sinan Can;Acan, Naciye Leyla",10.1002/bmb.21299,ProQuest
STEAM: Choreographing the Phases of the Moon,"STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) lessons have leaned heavily on the visual arts in interdisciplinary preservice learning. For preservice teachers, the application of STEAM pedagogies encourages complexity of thought connecting with their past and new experiences as well as greater self-awareness and risk-taking. Preservice teachers and elementary school students are introduced into the communicative and dynamic power of the arts through creative interdisciplinary teamwork in STEAM lessons. To enhance the impact of arts integration, dance/movement has the potential to add a kinetic connection to the study of the changing phases of the moon. Neuroscientists have begun to focus on physical movement as a means to demystify how the brain coordinates with the body to perform complex precise movements that express emotion and convey meaning (Hanna 2015). Choreographing movement most closely mirrors the actual progressive changes of the appearance of the moon in the night sky. This article describes a K-6 preservice course in which the content and activities included dance/movement and the making of visual art as props to teach about the eight phases of the moon over the course of a month combined with the nightly journey of the moon across the sky.","Fattal, Laura;An, Heejung",10.1080/15290824.2019.1664745,ProQuest
"Celestial calendar-paintings and culture-based digital storytelling: cross-cultural, interdisciplinary, STEM/STEAM resources for authentic astronomy education engagement","In D(L)akota star knowledge, the Sun is known as Wi and the Moon is Han-Wi . They have an important relationship, husband and wife. The pattern of their ever-changing relationship is mirrored in the motions of Sun and Moon as seen from our backyards, also called the lunar phases. The framework of the cultural teaching is storytelling and relationships. Cultural perspectives in astronomy such as this remind us of how indigenous ways of knowing are rooted in inclusion, engagement, and relevancy. Designed by A. Lee in 2007, the Native Skywatchers initiative seeks to remember and revitalize indigenous star and earth knowledge, promoting the native voice as the lead voice. The overarching goal of Native Skywatchers is to communicate the knowledge that indigenous people traditionally practiced a sustainable way of living and sustainable engineering through a living and participatory relationship with the above and below, sky and earth. In 2012 two indigenous star maps were created: the Ojibwe Giizhig Anung Masinaaigan -Ojibwe Sky Star Map (A. Lee, W. Wilson, C. Gawboy), and the D(L)akota star map, Makoce Wicanhpi Wowapi (A. Lee, J. Rock). In 2016, a collaboration with W. Buck of the Manitoba First Nations Resource Centre (MFNRC), produced a third star map: Ininew Achakos Masinikan - Cree Star Map Book. We aim to improve current inequities in education for native young people especially through STEM engagement, to inspire increased cultural pride, and promote community wellness. Presented here will be recently created resources such as: astronomical calendar-paintings and short videos that exist at the intersection of art-science-culture. As we look for sustainable ways to widen participation in STEM, particularly in astronomy education, part of the conversation needs to consider the place for art and culture in STEM.","Lee, Annette S;Wilson, William;Tibbetts, Jeff;Gawboy, Cark;Meyer, Anne;Buck, Wilfred;Knutson-Kolodzne, Jim;Pantalony, David",10.1051/epjconf/201920001002,ProQuest
Design and Analysis of Solar Desalination System Using Compound Parabolic Concentrator,Both in the developed and developing countries availability of drinking water is the main priority of human being. Fresh water available in nature 3% on the earth. This research is an attempt to use solar energy for conversion of hard water to soft water using compound parabolic concentrator. Soft water which is useful for drinking is in shortfall. This research is an attempt to haunt solar energy to desalinate hard water into portable water. A solar thermal desalination system has been proposed whereby heat from solar energy is utilised for heating hard (salt) water which is passed through cupper tubes and compound parabolic concentrator placed bottom of the cupper tubes to get maximum temperature in the form of steam. The steam thus formed is passed through a condenser where it condenses to get soft water. This theoretical analysis gives approximately 3-4 litres soft water per hour. It will be considerably higher amount of fresh water and it would be an ideal solution to produce drinkable water for local residents for Pune City which was located in western region in India.,"Kedar, S A;K Arul Raj;Bewoor, A K",10.1088/1757-899X/455/1/012063,ProQuest
"Crosscutting Literature on STEAM Ecosystems, Expectancy Value Theory, and Social Emotional Learning: A Metadata Synthesis. Research Report. ETS RR-18-33","In this report, we describe the initial stages of a crosscutting research effort to characterize literature reviewed across 8 different projects--each with objectives aligned toward improving student engagement in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) fields. These projects sought to identify malleable factors (e.g., motivation, persistence) that could potentially be fostered to improve achievement motivation and build participation among historically underrepresented learners in STEAM pathways. Focusing on both the extent to which different broad and facet-level constructs are both discussed and assessed in a diverse pool of literature, we developed a standardized reporting structure and catalogued detailed information on 236 unique references. We found that, as a proportion of the number of times constructs in the STEAM, expectancy value (EV) theory, and social emotional learning (SEL) spaces were discussed in the reviewed literature, they were assessed relatively infrequently. We also found high levels of overlap in the literature across the above 3 focal areas, highlighting both the need to document new assessments designed to support STEAM engagement and an opportunity to use them to evaluate expectancy value theory as a holistic model.","Rikoon, Samuel;Finn, Bridgid;Jackson, Teresa;Inglese, Patricia",,ProQuest
Library and Student Innovation Center: Makerspace!,"The College of Engineering and Applied Science together with the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Education, and the UW Libraries developed a Library/Student Innovation Center (LIC/SIC), Makerspace, to spark student innovation, creativity, and design skills. In May 2012, Governor Mead, the State legislature, and the Wyoming Governor’s Energy, Engineering, STEM Integration Taskforce articulated a vision to propel the College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS) and the University of Wyoming to the realms of excellence in instruction, research, and service.” Part of this initiative included active learning “Makerspace” in the new Engineering Education and Research Building (EERB). Makerspace employs technology along with hands-on education to spark student innovation, creativity, design and entrepreneurship. The UW Libraries has graciously provided 2500 square feet of space to develop a prototype Library Innovation Center during the Fall 2016 semester. Lessons learned and equipment purchased will form the basis of the Student Innovation Center planned for the EERB. Ground breaking for the EERB was October 7, 2016 with a scheduled completion of Spring 2019. The goal of the LIC/SIC is to provide experiential learning space for STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) students. The LIC/SIC provides a location for students to explore ideas, complete class projects, or pursue an entrepreneurial innovation. Also, the space is available to conduct classes and workshops. The space is coordinated and managed by an onsite specialist. The Library/Student Innovation Center planning team consists of an interdisciplinary group of faculty members and students with a common interest – hands on, innovative learning. In this paper we provide detailed information in developing a Makerspace including equipment selection, staffing, funding, day-to-day operations and lessons learned. This paper serves as a useful guide for other institutions considering standing up a makerspace.","Barrett, Steven F;Dousay, Tonia A;Kerr, Tyler J;Schmidt, Larry;Gellis, Brandon Seth;Ballard, Jesse",,ProQuest
"Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) Diplomacy: Preliminary Results from an Initial Pilot Course","The emergent, interdisciplinary topic of “Science Diplomacy” includes: 1) training scientists to serve as diplomats (i.e., integrating the ‘art’ of political science into the STEM disciplines to create STEAM – science, technology, engineering, art, and math), 2) empowering countries to collaborate on scientific advancement through diplomacy (i.e., CERN and the international space station), and 3) building cross-cultural relationships among scientists from different countries (i.e., Fulbright exchange in STEM disciplines). Because science diplomacy occurs at the nexus of diverse disciplines, it is simultaneously difficult for a single individual to learn the full range of topics necessary to offer such a course, and it is structurally problematic for two or more faculty from diverse academic departments (often in different colleges) to co-teach such a course (i.e., cross listing a course among a Department of Engineering and a Department of Political Science can be a challenge). Nonetheless, training students in Science Diplomacy is critically important to – inter alia – manage the global environment (i.e., polar regions, oceans, transnational freshwater, biodiversity, and atmospheric quality), to protect global health (i.e., biodefense, pandemics, and emergent infections), and to share human-made technological ecosystems (i.e., infrastructure, energy production, outer space, and the internet). Recognizing the need to bridge science and diplomacy, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) created the Center for Science Diplomacy, launched the quarterly publication, Science &amp; Diplomacy, and has begun to offer short courses and research gatherings. A very limited number of institutions have also begun to offer courses on “Science Diplomacy” – Tufts, Columbia, and NYU – and some institutions are creating MOOCs in science diplomacy – SUNY has a MOOC with a specialization in global health diplomacy. Recently, a monograph originally prepared in French was translated into English and is being marketed by Springer as a ‘text book’ for Science Diplomacy instruction. Through a Presidential initiative at our university, a new course, cross-listed between the a Department of Engineering and a Department of Political Science has been developed. The course consists of three major cognitive (knowledge) activities, including: 1) students complete low-level Bloom’s taxonomy learning (i.e., recall) through listening to pre-recorded lectures, reviewing assigned reading, and completing low-stakes, frequent online quizzes (i.e., a flipped classroom); 2) students complete high-level Bloom’s taxonomy learning (i.e., creation) through the preparation of two, term-length written documents, namely: a) the construction of a new, comprehensive case study of science diplomacy on a topic selected by the student and approved by the instructor; and b) an application for a science diplomacy fellowship/internship/scholarship (i.e., term-length inductive learning); and 3) students complete mid-level Bloom’s taxonomy learning (i.e., analysis) through completing five, one-page, essays in response to existing case studies (i.e., rubric-based grading of essays). To accommodate the diverse learning styles and preferred means of assessment for a diverse student population across multiple disciplines, course grading also includes asynchronous, regular participation in an online discussion board (i.e., course participation), a written midterm, and a written final exam all aimed at low and mid-level Bloom’s taxonomy learning. A ‘buffet approach’ is used to assign final grades with students completing a sub-set of available assignments providing ample opportunities for each student to demonstrate ‘excellence’ (i.e., ‘A’) in learning the cognitive content. To supplement the cognitive (knowledge) content, learning in the affective (attitude) domain is achieved through online journaling with self-assessment, peer feedback, and instructor evaluation. Code-word searches are used to document personal growth in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Learning in the psychomotor (skills) domain is achieved through mock negotiations among teams of students employing a Model United Nations activity. This article will present the format of the course and the results of evaluation of a pilot offering.","Oerther, Daniel B",,ProQuest
Students' Planetarium,"Our students built a full-size, mobile planetarium in three weeks. The planetarium was built with commonly available, cheap construction materials. Our priorities were mobility, possibility of quick assembly and reassembly and the students' availability of materials in every place in the world. The students calculated all the parameters of the planetarium's construction themselves, chose materials of appropriate technical parameters, built the planetarium's framework, elaborated the methods of projections and sounding. Taking into consideration the spectators' comfort they also designed systems of air conditioning and cooling. The project is completely consistent with the STEM and even the STEAM method. The artistic factor of the students' work was revealed during the visualisation of planetarium projections and its adornment. The final product of their work is a functional planetarium and a manual for its construction.","Brozis, Mirosaw;Swiderski, Kamil",,ProQuest
Convergence – an Engineering and Arts Education Project that Brings Together Faculty and Students of Different Disciplines and Nationalities,"Engineering and art were not always completely separate disciplines. Take Leonardo da Vinci (born 1452) for example, who was equally as great an artist as an engineer. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in efforts to bring these disciplines more closely together by adding the Arts back into STEM education – or moving from STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) to STEAM (science, technology, arts, engineering, and math). Engineering may give you the skills to design and build, but the Arts will give you the ability to design and build for the human condition. This paper describes a 6 month long engineering and arts education project we’ve named Convergence. The project, made up of a multi-disciplinary and multi-national faculty and student team, involves the design and manufacture of 100 smart LED lighted miniature vessels that float down the river a river with two different colors only to converge to one color further downstream. The convergence of the vessels themselves is symbolic of the convergence of the disciplines and nationalities of the people who designed and built the project and indicative of how combining engineering with the arts can help impart a social message – the need for convergence in a disparate world. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We begin by introducing the origin of the project idea and the formation of the multi-disciplinary, multi-national team. We then describe the engineering design of the project and the tests performed to verify its functionality. We conclude by discussing the results of the final demonstration of the project and the perceptions of the project’s impact from those involved in its making.","Benson, Bridget;Matt Jamison Burnett",,ProQuest
Examining the Experiences of First-Year Honors Engineering Students in Service-Learning,"While research-projects and skill-based courses are critical in engineering and computer science curricula, service-learning has been highlighted as a worthwhile experience for all students. Specifically, this pedagogy has been shown to be beneficial in helping students from underrepresented groups who typically lack opportunities to gain technical experience prior to embarking on higher education garner experience in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM). This research study explores the experiences of a small group of Introduction to Engineering Honors students during Fall 2016 and Fall 2017. Working in teams within their respective classes, both sets of students were required to design and execute a service-learning project aimed at teaching middle-school aged children about STEAM. This mandatory project entailed creating a presentation and preparing a hands-on activity to be presented at an afterschool program at a local center for adolescents. The goals of this service-learning experience for both parties were mutual. Through their participation, the Honors engineering and computer science students gained experience in strategic teamwork and effective communication with a non-technical audience and developed a clear self-concept regarding their motivations and goals in pursuing engineering or computer science. Simultaneously, the middle-school aged teenagers at the center for adolescents gained exposure to the work of engineers and computer scientists and a glimpse into the life of a college student, meeting the surrounding low income, low access community’s need to increase students’ interest in STEAM fields and motivation to pursue higher education. Upon completing their service-learning presentation, each engineering student will be administered a survey calling them to reflect on their experience and how relevant they feel it is to their formation and goals as engineers and computer scientists. One key point to note is that the primary researcher was one of the college students surveyed in the first group of participants. Students in the second group of participants will also be given the opportunity to participate in a focus group, where they will be encouraged to think deeper about their experience working with the local adolescents, their aspirations in engineering or computer science, and the key points they took away from the project that are applicable to their professional careers. All students’ responses will be analyzed with special interest paid to how students’ experiences differed based on their gender, past engineering or computer science experiences, and future goals. It is important to note that this study is a work-in-progress.","Bellizzi, Ava Madeline;Lord, Susan M;Reddy, Elizabeth A",,ProQuest

Unlocking Learning II: Math as a Lever for English Learner Equity,"Wide and persistent gaps in math achievement separate English learners from their English-proficient peers. The consequences of these gaps are severe and long lasting. Without a solid foundation in math, students are less likely to access and excel in college preparatory math and science classes in high school. Without high-level math classes in high school, students have fewer college and career opportunities, especially in the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) fields that are increasingly in high demand in California.

"Playing, Debugging, Learning: A Proposal between Game and Instructional Designs via Extended Prototyping","This article investigates the phenomenon of open and participative development (e.g. beta testing, Kickstarter projects)--i.e. extended prototyping--in digital entertainment as a potential source of insights for instructional interventions. Despite the increasing popularity of this practice and the potential implications for educators and instructional designers, little efforts have been done in enlightening the topic. This study aims to address this lack by staging a bridge between Instructional Design and Game Design with an empirical inquiry. N:130 subjects (beta testers and Steam Early Access and Kickstarter users) were recruited with a quantitative questionnaire about their contribution to open development instances. Behavioral patterns, effective policies and managements, and subjective profiles and opinions were gathered and tied to instructional design models and concepts. Results point to successful techniques in designing and applying such a process, while mistakes and unproductive tactics are highlighted as well. To summarize, instruction can take advantage of an increased participation of targeted audiences/learners to its development phases. Benefits span transparency, engagement, and commitment. However, poor communication and incoherence between testing and final product may weaken the overall outcome.","Gandolfi, Enrico",10.1177/2042753018757079,ProQuest
"Innovating Industrial Design Curriculum in a Knowledge-Based, Participatory and Digital Era","This article discusses three years' research (2012-2014) on design education towards a 2016 undergraduate industrial design curriculum launch. It contributes a pathway for conservative courses towards design culture transformation and filling gaps between them and leading breakthrough education exemplars. The course proposes a collective knowledge creation model through social constructivism and constructionism that recognises its place in time and history and allows customisation to individual upbringing. It catches up with a profession transformed beyond a digital Bauhaus manifesto that joined and revaluated physical and digital artefacts as per their environment, quality of experiences, intelligence, networks and relations. Data and findings supported pedagogy redefinition from master-apprentice and teacher-centred skill transmission models to heutagogy and paragogy. The new approach required habitus change from a traditional goods-centred discipline to human-centred focus, critical design and making, design heuristics, CDIO (conceiving, designing, implementing, operating) and STEAM (science, technology, arts, mathematics) frameworks. Participants empathetically contextualised, problem framed and solved by crossing boundaries between disciplines, institutions, industries, students' background and society. Research and practice promoted new forms of industrial design creation happening in physical and digital coexisting spaces of being. Course units evolved around an e-curriculum component working as a digital spine. Curriculum progressed from standard top-down transmission to sociotechnical and organisational networking, industry collaboration, international design studio and Design Factory model-like projects. In doing so, it became a foundation for future physical-digital industrial design artefacts, human computer interaction, machine learning, hacker culture systems, shared information, free open-source software and hardware development within a 4.0 industrial revolution.","Novoa, Mauricio",,ProQuest
"The STEAM Dance Makerspace: A Context for Integration: An Investigation of Learning at the Intersections of STEM, Art, Making and Embodiment","This dissertation is an ethnographic study of the dance makerspace, a learning environment designed to support STEM engagement through making and embodied experience for a group of African American youth dancers. It looks at how participants in a 4-week summer camp program at an urban creative arts center-turned-makerspace, constructed embodied understandings as they developed projects that integrated STEM, dance, and making. Through a detailed analysis of the dance makerspace design, and of participant engagement in activities, I investigated what it meant to do science in an informal out-of-school context, where activities were guided by children's interests and ideas, and where learning science was not necessarily the ultimate goal. In this dissertation, I will share analyses from the perspectives of designer, facilitator, and participant researcher, the three roles I played in the study. I examine how factors related to design and facilitation influenced youth engagement with STEM. I also examined dance as an interest, a representational medium, and a tool for sense-making, using ethnographic descriptions to show how and what youth learned as they engaged in embodied sense-making practices; and the relationships between STEM, art, making and the body when dance was used as a representational medium. This work brings readers inside the making process and demonstrates the potential for conceptual learning outcomes in informal STEAM making spaces. The findings show how the design and facilitation of activities created opportunities for youth to engage meaningfully in STEM in ways that are nontraditional, utilize their bodies for sense-making, and integrate STEM and arts practices. These findings further our understanding of STEAM learning in makerspaces, and they have broader theoretical and methodological implications. First, the study lends empirical support to research on making to learn by demonstrating how STEAM making can lead to conceptual understanding. It also expands ways of perceiving the body's role in cognition and sense-making, broadening definitions of cognition, and provides evidence to counter characterizations of cognition that separate mind and body. Further, the study provides methods for evaluating learning in informal settings where learning goals are not based on specific science content, and particularly when the products being evaluated are multimodal and non-verbal.

To determine the effectiveness of TTP and its effect on middle school students' computational thinking skills, a mixed methodology was adopted in which both a quasi-experimental design including a pretest-posttest control group and an observational case study were used concurrently. The study group consisted of eighth-grade students from a public middle school in Turkey, selected according to the convenient sampling method. A computational thinking test was used to collect quantitative data, and observations and semi-structured interviews were utilized for the collection of qualitative data. According to the results of analyses, when the effects of the pretest scores were not considered, there was a significant difference (F[subscript 0.469], 1, R[superscript 2] = 0.518) between the final test scores of the experimental and control groups in favor of the former. Based on these findings, it can be stated that the proposed STEAM-based program significantly improves the computational thinking skills of eighth-grade middle school students.","Bati, Kaan;Yetisir, Mehmet Ikbal;Çaliskan, Ilke;Günes, Gökhan;Gül Saçan, Esma",10.1080/2331186X.2018.1507306,ProQuest

Innovating Industrial Design Curriculum in a Knowledge-Based and Participatory Digital Era,"This article narrates on three years participatory research between 2012 and 2014 and its formulation for a 2016 undergraduate industrial design curriculum launch. It contributes to design culture transformation since there are leading breakthrough education exemplars but lack of pathways to get there by conservative courses and institutions. The course proposes an individual and collective knowledge creation model through social constructivism and constructionism that recognises its place in time and history. It intends catching up with a profession transformed beyond a digital Bauhaus manifesto that bridges physical and digital artefacts, space and environments through quality of experiences, intelligence, networks and relations. Data and practice supported pedagogy redefinition from master-apprentice and teacher-centred skill transmission models to heutagogy and paragogy. The new approach required habitus change from a traditional goods-centred discipline to human-centred focus, critical design and making, design heuristics, CDIO (conceiving, designing, implementing, operating) and STEAM (science, technology, arts, mathematics) frameworks. Participants worked empathetically to contextualise, problem frame and solve by crossing boundaries between disciplines, institutions, industries, and students’ background and society. Research and practice promoted new forms of industrial design creation happening in physical and digital coexisting spaces of being. The curriculum expressed through units that evolved around an e-curriculum component working as a digital spine that progressed from standard social networking and industry collaboration to international design studio and design factory projects. It became foundation for future physical-digital industrial design artefacts, human computer interaction, machine learning, and systems built on hacker culture, shared information, free open-source software and hardware.","Novoa, Mauricio",,ProQuest
Indigenous Making and Sharing: Claywork in an Indigenous STEAM Program,"In this article we expand on ideas of making and maker spaces to develop Indigenous making and sharing. We draw from an ArtScience participatory design project that involved Indigenous youth, families, community artists, and scientists in a summer Indigenous STEAM program designed to cultivate social and ecologically just nature-culture relations grounded in Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and making. In this article we focus specifically on clay making and the ways in which onto-epistemic heterogeneity can be engaged to create transformative maker spaces. We present findings from an analysis of the pedagogies of walking, observing and talking lands and waters to outline principles of Indigenous making and sharing in youth-based learning environments.","Barajas-López, Filiberto;Bang, Megan",10.1080/10665684.2018.1437847,ProQuest
Thermodynamic Analysis of Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Power Cycle with Fluidized Bed Coal Combustion,"Closed supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO 2 ) Brayton cycle is a promising alternative to steam Rankine cycle due to higher cycle efficiency at equivalent turbine inlet conditions, which has been explored to apply to nuclear, solar power, waste heat recovery, and coal-fired power plant. This study establishes 300MW S-CO 2 power system based on modified recompression Brayton cycle integrated with coal-fired circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler. The influences of two stages split flow on system performance have been investigated in detail. In addition, thermodynamic analysis of critical operating parameters has been carried out, including terminal temperature difference, turbine inlet pressure/temperature, reheat stages, and parameters as well as compressor inlet pressure/temperature. The results show that rational distribution of split ratio to the recompressor (SR 1 ) achieves maximal cycle efficiency where heat capacities of both sides in the low temperature recuperator (LTR) realize an excellent matching. The optimal SR 1 decreases in the approximately linear proportion to high pressure turbine (HPT) inlet pressure due to gradually narrowing specific heat differences in the LTR. Secondary split ratio to the economizer of CFB boiler (SR 2 ) can recover moderate flue gas heat caused by narrow temperature range and improve boiler efficiency. Smaller terminal temperature difference corresponds to higher efficiency and brings about larger cost and pressure drops of the recuperators, which probably decrease efficiency conversely. Single reheat improves cycle efficiency by 1.5% under the condition of 600°C/600°C/25Mpa while efficiency improvement for double reheat is less obvious compared to steam Rankine cycle largely due to much lower pressure ratio. Reheat pressure and main compressor (MC) inlet pressure have corresponding optimal values. HPT and low pressure turbine (LPT) inlet temperature both have positive influences on system performance.","Geng, Chenchen;Shao, Yingjuan;Zhong, Wenqi;Liu, Xuejiao",10.1155/2018/6963292,ProQuest
Window to the World,"Although formal papers are typical, sometimes posters or other visual presentations are more useful tools for sharing visual-spatial information. By incorporating creativity and technology into the study of geographical science, STEM (the study of Science, Technology Engineering, and Mathematics) is changed to STEAM (the A stands for ART)! The guiding structure of this activity is geographic inquiry, as described in the ""3C Framework for Social Studies Standards."" The Window to the World Project began as a middle-grades classroom activity where students looked at their individual strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats using a SWOT Analysis Chart. Then, they explored their interests, hobbies, and possible future endeavors, narrowing down ideas for research. Once they determined one possible interest or passion, they explored the feasibility of spending multiple days working on a geography project based on that one interest. All the while, the teacher guided the students through an exploration based on what Gersmehl describes as the ""Four Cornerstones of Geography (Gersmehl, 2014). Their WINDOWS are visual stories expressing individual interests and connections to different locations, places, and spaces on Earth. Students presented their windows in a common area outside the school cafeteria in a ""Window Session."" In this lesson, students construct a ""window to the world"" foldable world geography project that reflects their personal interests. The lesson can be geared toward elementary, intermediate, or high school classes and takes 3-5 hours to complete.","Cannon, Kama",10.1080/19338341.2017.1413003,ProQuest
Scientists for Tomorrow - A Self-Sustained Initiative to Promote STEM in Out-of-School Time Frameworks in Under-served Community-Based Organizations: Evaluation and Lessons Learned,"On 2011, the Scientists for Tomorrow (SfT) Initiative started with the support of an NSF-ISE grant for a period of two years serving 15 sites. Today the initiative is in its sixth year, serving more than 40 community based organizations (CBOs) sites, 600 middle school student and 150 parents per semester in a self-sustained mode. The SfT initiative is designed to provide urban youth in Chicago with information and skills related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers and foster positive attitudes toward Stem subjects and related careers. Given that the initiative is hosted in the Department of Science and Mathematics – Columbia College Chicago, an art and media school, the contents promoted in the communities include also an Art component, changing from STEM to STEAM. The initiative is a partnership between a higher education institutions, local community based organizations (CBO’s) and local Informal Science Education providers. In the original design, the implementation of the program in the communities during the academic year, was divided into 3 sessions of 10 weeks: Fall (October-December); Winter (January- March) and Spring (April – June). Each session explores a different module such as Alternative Energies, Physics of Sound and Mathematics of Music, People and Plants, Robotics or Astronomy. Before each session starts, SfT provides more than 15 hours of professional development for all of the instructors involved in the program (staff members from the CBO’s, grad and undergrad students). Each session includes 10 meetings (once per week) of 90 minutes with an end of the module showcase the last session. At the end of each module, all of the CBO’s sites participate in a Family Science Day in one of the ISE venues partners: Museum of Science and Industry (December), Field Museum (March), and Garfield Conservatory (June). The question the initiative explores is if there are changes in participants’ and CBOs leadership attitude towards STEAM and gain of content knowledge. For this effect, participants are given a pre and post attitude test for each module per session, in order to determine their knowledge and awareness towards STEM. These tests are scored through an external evaluator and provide quality information for how to modify curriculum in the future. Additionally, all instructors are required to complete Activity Journal Logs after each of their class sessions. These internal evaluations allow instructors to reflect on their formative assessment techniques, as well as find where they needed more support. Leadership within the program reads the logs daily and reacts accordingly, providing all necessary resources. Finally, the Community Site Director, Coordinators and Volunteers are given a survey to evaluate the program as a whole, at the end of each module. These are internally analyzed to find effective improve the partnership as well as their STEAM afterschool program. The result of the four years external evaluation (two years of the grants and two years no-cost extension) shows that the initiative has a significant positive impact in the attitude toward STEM of the participants as well as in their gain of content knowledge. Also shows a significant positive change of attitude from the CBO’s leadership toward the introduction of STEAM academic enrichment activities as part of the regular activities in their OST programs. Some of the learned lessons include 1) the need to have more parental involvement in the OST activities of their children to ensure the success of the initiative, 2) have a flexible professional development and instructors follow up strategy to ensure the quality of the learning process and the growth of the CBOs capacity to continue promoting STEAM as an integral part of their OST educational offer, and 3) the need to promote the public perception that OST learning is important as formal education to promote the children, especially in under-served communities.","Caplan, Marcelo",,ProQuest
"Editorial Board Thoughts: Arts into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics - STEAM, Creative Abrasion, and the Opportunity in Libraries Today","Rather than a continued focus on hyper-specialization and separation, we have the opportunity to rethink the library: exploring novel configurations and services that might better support its community, and embracing emerging roles of trans-disciplinary collaboration and innovation. The Library as Intersection Libraries reflect the institutional and organizational structures of their communities, even as the physical organization of the structures built to house print collections mirror the classification system in use. Specialized almost to the exclusion of other areas of study altogether, in branch libraries of a college or university this division can reach a pinnacle; libraries and collections devoted to exclusive topics of engineering, science, music, and others, exist on campuses across the country. Without active intervention and deliberate effort on the part of the library, opportunities for creative abrasion3 and trans-disciplinary collaboration become virtually non-existent; its potential to ""unleash the creative potential that is latent in a collection of unlike-minded individuals,""4 untapped.

STEM and the Arts and Humanities: Debunking a False Dichotomy,"The false dichotomy that suggests schools must choose between STEM (or STEAM) and the humanities would not merit the time it takes to write an article if not for a dangerous crescendo of backlash clouding the senses of boards and administrations around the independent school world.

Taipei American School is a K-12 American independent school located in a vibrant international capital city. It is clear to the author that vibrant, challenging arts and humanities courses are as relevant and popular as ever, and embracing STEM neither condones nor encourages slighting the humanistic heritage that gives meaning to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.","Hartzell, Richard",,ProQuest
Live Contact with the International Space Station from School,"The Royal Masonic School for Girls made history in February 2016 when it became the first school to establish a video link with the International Space Station via amateur radio--the result of a competition run by ARISS. Six girls from year 9 (age 13-14 years) qualified for Foundation Amateur Radio Licences, and students across the school took part in space-related activities during the buildup to the link-up. During the 10 minute link-up, made possible by the ARISS UK Operations team, students could see Tim on a big screen and asked him prepared questions covering space activities and careers; the event was also streamed live. This unique event provided considerable insight into ""physics in action"" and visits by speakers from the European Space Agency, defence, aerospace and security agency QinetiQ, Airbus, and a former student now at the UK Space Agency, have enthused our students about science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) careers.","Timoney, Natalile",,ProQuest
Young Makers Compare Science Fairs and Maker Faires,"Participation in the school-based science fair is ubiquitous to the middle-school student. Rising in popularity is the community based, extracurricular Maker Faire for the young tinkerer or maker. With this study, we share perceptions of these 2 canonical STEM events from the perspective of Young Makers. We report on the perceptions of science fairs and Maker Fairs from the perspective of 35 young Makers ages 7-18, who participated in a flagship Maker Faires in the United States. Using thematic analysis we analyze their responses during qualitative interviews and report on their impressions of their science fairs and Maker Faires experiences. Both science fairs and Maker Faires present authentic STEM learning opportunities for the K-12 student. They have similar formats where the student presents work that they have done, both the process and end product or result. Opportunities often arise in both to engage and excite a student in an area of curiosity. Both types of fairs want their participants to interact with each other and provide each other with feedback and a learning environment. They also want the participants to well document their projects. Emerging themes indicate both similarities and differences and how those affect the projects represented in each. Both types of fairs are unique and provide a learning experience for their respective participants. Participating in Maker Faires is, study participants believe, provides more applied learning about science, engineering, and community concepts as compared to their participation in science fairs. Maker Faires may provide an opportunity for schools to promote deeper learning. Additional analysis will explore this further. An example of a science fair is the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, around since the 1950s. ISEF materials define science fair as “research [as]… a process by which people discover or create new knowledge about the world in which they live…Students design research projects that provide quantitative data through experimentation followed by analysis and application of that data.” Specific learning objectives are learning the scientific method, answering a question, and communicating their research clearly. The science fair also offers an opportunity for feedback on how their project compares to others in a competitive school setting (with awards at the local, regional and national competition level). Organizers describe Maker Faire as “part science fair, part county fair, and part something entirely new, …an all-ages gathering of tech enthusiasts, crafters, educators, tinkerers, hobbyists, engineers, science clubs, authors, artists, students, and commercial exhibitors.” Maker Faires have become increasingly popular since inception more than 10 years ago, with attendance at flagship Bay Area Maker Faire reaching 130,000 and 85,000 at the flagship New York Maker Faire. Aims are promoting self-motivated learning, give makers a place to freely show of their project, and to be transformation educational experience. An increasing trend is bringing making activities to K-12 in the classroom, in collaborative maker spaces, and through clubs. This may allow for opportunities to benefit from both science fairs and Maker Faires, including a new initiative to have Maker Faires at schools. We will present implications for STEM and STEAM informal learning and means to engage in STEM, and particularly engineering, in and outside of the science classroom in K-12 education.","Mabey, Miles J;Lande, Micah;Jordan, Shawn S",10.18260/p.27066,ProQuest
MAKER: Come to the Dark Side—We Have Cookies: Creating an Interactive Display to Engage Everyone in STEAM,"In a not so distant place, in a galaxy much similar to our own we find ourselves delving into the “dark side” of things to engage students. Find out how a somewhat non-traditional approach to student and community engagement has lead to huge interest in the STEAM fields at [name removed]. This maker demonstration will showcase how utilizing a theme such as Star Wars creates a framework for student exploration into the maker field. We will present multiple maker components created by students to work both independently and to become part of a larger interactive display focused around a common theme. Each maker piece will have accompanying instructions on how to design and build it; as well as we will be providing the larger framework guidelines to be able to replicate such an interactive display in a variety of academic programs (K-12 to college). This approach allows for students’ personalized learning on their own maker project while bringing into view the bigger picture of the needs for design specifications and the utilization of skills outside their traditional areas of study. The maker components include Arduinos, LEDs, stepper motors, 3D printed objects, etc. Thus begins a new hope for STEAM. It is a period of academic unrest as we venture to the dark side and bring about a period of personalized engagement.

"""Finding the Joy in the Unknown"": Implementation of STEAM Teaching Practices in Middle School Science and Math Classrooms","In response to a desire to strengthen the economy, educational settings are emphasizing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum and programs. Yet, because of the narrow approach to STEM, educational leaders continue to call for a more balanced approach to teaching and learning, which includes the arts, design, and humanities. This desire created space for science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education, a transdisciplinary approach that focuses on problem-solving. STEAM-based curricula and STEAM-themed schools are appearing all over the globe. This growing national and global attention to STEAM provides an opportunity for teacher education to explore the ways in which teachers implement STEAM practices, examining the successes and challenges, and how teachers are beginning to make sense of this innovative teaching practice. The purpose of this paper is to examine the implementation of STEAM teaching practices in science and math middle school classrooms, in hopes to provide research-based evidence on this emerging topic to guide teacher educators.","Quigley, Cassie F.;Herro, Dani",10.1007/s10956-016-9602-z,ProQuest
Global root zone storage capacity from satellite-based evaporation,"This study presents an “Earth observation-based” method for estimating root zone storage capacity – a critical, yet uncertain parameter in hydrological and land surface modelling. By assuming that vegetation optimises its root zone storage capacity to bridge critical dry periods, we were able to use state-of-the-art satellite-based evaporation data computed with independent energy balance equations to derive gridded root zone storage capacity at global scale. This approach does not require soil or vegetation information, is model independent, and is in principle scale independent. In contrast to a traditional look-up table approach, our method captures the variability in root zone storage capacity within land cover types, including in rainforests where direct measurements of root depths otherwise are scarce. Implementing the estimated root zone storage capacity in the global hydrological model STEAM (Simple Terrestrial Evaporation to Atmosphere Model) improved evaporation simulation overall, and in particular during the least evaporating months in sub-humid to humid regions with moderate to high seasonality. Our results suggest that several forest types are able to create a large storage to buffer for severe droughts (with a very long return period), in contrast to, for example, savannahs and woody savannahs (medium length return period), as well as grasslands, shrublands, and croplands (very short return period). The presented method to estimate root zone storage capacity eliminates the need for poor resolution soil and rooting depth data that form a limitation for achieving progress in the global land surface modelling community.","Wang-Erlandsson, Lan;Bastiaanssen, Wim G M;Gao, Hongkai;Jägermeyr, Jonas;Senay, Gabriel B;Albert I J M van Dijk;Guerschman, Juan P;Keys, Patrick W;Gordon, Line J;Savenije, Hubert H G",10.5194/hess-20-1459-2016,ProQuest
Dancing with STEAM: Creative Movement Generates Electricity for Young Learners,"The integration of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) serves to develop creative thinking and twenty-first-century skills in the classroom (Maeda 2012). Learning through STEAM promotes novelty, innovation, ingenuity, and task-specific purposefulness to solve real-world problems--all aspects that define creativity. Lisa Fanning is a fifth-grade teacher at a public elementary school with school-wide arts integration at the core of its vision. Fanning participated in a district-wide professional development project through which she partnered with a dance teaching artist. Together with her partner, she engaged in a 12-hour workshop to develop common understandings about curricular intersections, practiced co-teaching structures, and devised essential questions to guide their lesson planning. They subsequently engaged in 24 hours of additional professional development during a summer institute to learn specific methodology in dance integration, including elements, strategies, and facilitation techniques. During the summer institute, Jamie Simpson Steele (a performing arts specialist) and Lori Fulton (a science educator) provided a framework for thinking about STEAM intersections and examples of art and science integrated experiences for teachers and teaching artists. Next, Fanning and her teaching artist partner co-planned and co-taught a semester-long inquiry to investigate this question: How does energy transform? This inquiry engaged students in hands-on activities, field-based experiences, interviews with experts, science notebooks, creative movement improvisation, dance choreography, and a call for social activism. The collaborations consisted of ten sessions of planning time and ten co-taught lessons in the classroom. Fanning's unit focused on the properties of wind and how its energy could be stored, transformed, and transferred for use. The science objective required students to describe how later when they engineered turbines). To explore the relationship among the earth, sea, and sky, students connected to their personal experiences at the beach and did further observation and research. Students converted these ideas into a model by expanding, rising, and pushing their bodies through space. Finally, students responded to the work of their peers, practicing artistic thinking by observing, describing, and interpreting each other's movements (Harris 2013). The unit culminated in a public performance with invited parents and community members. During this sharing, students performed original choreography, exhibited wind turbines, led station activities to inform their guests about the wind as a source of energy, and engaged in a mock demonstration advocating for renewable energy.","Simpson Steele, Jamie;Fulton, Lori;Fanning, Lisa",10.1080/15290824.2016.1175570,ProQuest
Changing the World for Good: Tech Trek Alabama Changes 8th Grade Girls’ Attitudes Towards STEM,"Changing the World for Good: Tech Trek Alabama Changes 8th Grade Girls’ Attitudes Towards STEM The American Association of University Women (AAUW) research report ”Why SoFew? Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)” found thatwomen are vastly underrepresented in STEM majors and fields compared with their male peers.But “Why So Few?” also showed that those numbers can change when girls realize theirpotential in STEM at an early age. In 2012, AAUW decided to provide girls across the countrythe opportunity to immerse themselves in hands-on exploration of STEM topics in order toencourage them to take more advanced STEM classes in high school and go on to major inSTEM fields in college. Using the model developed in California, AAUW brought Tech Trek, aweeklong summer camp for rising eighth-grade girls that is designed to develop interest,excitement, and self-confidence in STEM through classes, workshops, hands-on activities, andfield trips to four national sites in 2013.The inaugural Alabama Tech Trek camp, a partnership between the local AAUW branch andInstitution was held July 20-25, 2014. The girls spent 17.5 hours in core classes, choosing fromrobotics, app development, and life science. They also gained exposure to additional areas ofSTEM through workshops, a field trip, and evening activities. Technical workshops includedinstant challenges conducted by trained evaluators from Destination Imagination, rocket buildingand the engineering design process led by NASA Education, and DNA extraction at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. Non-technical presentations included communicating your bigidea, STEAM, and stress release.

Specifically, the following hypothesis-driven questions are investigated: • How does the design of the EdUCE program meet STEAM standards and expectations? • How is Systems Engineering (in particular design and development of CubeSats) correlated to the Backward Design approach that is adopted in educational curriculum? • How to use the arts to complement the understanding of STEM concepts with a focus on Systems Engineering? • How are digital platforms (i.e., interactive books, Web 2.0 and mobile apps) paired with hands-on activities an effective mechanism to enable learning? • What best practices have been targeted and implemented for dissemination of EdUCE?Backward Design approach is a tool used in elementary and secondary education to developcurricula and teaching lessons which involves the following phases: (1) determination of thelearning outcomes, (2) development of the assessments, and (3) design of the learningexperience; essentially, the process has the end in mind by first, identify the learning goals,next identify the metrics required to measure success, then finally design/implement thelearning activities to meet these goals, thus creating a systematic path. The SystemsEngineering process shares lots of parallelisms with Backward Design; it begins with a need(i.e., objective), assesses alternatives and designs and develops products and activities (i.e.,verification and validation, operations, sustainment, and retirement) to satisfy the need in asystematic way.Via this approach, educators and techinical subject matter experts collaborate in thedevelopment process and manage age appropriate curriculum, thus unifying and broadeningboth the number and quality of K-20 participants worldwide. To demonstrate, an example ofengaging curriculum is presented. The end-to-end design and development process and thelife experiences from a CubeSat program are the major contributing factors in engaging theparticipants, however, complementary space activities, such as microgravity experiments,high altitude balloon experiments, and CanSats are included. Additionally, this is integratedwith the use of digital platforms to increase the awareness and the emphasis on STEAM.","Shiotani, Bungo;Buckley, Dante Augustus;Bumbaco, Amy Elizabeth;Fitz-Coy, Norman G",10.18260/p.23905,ProQuest
Transformation of STEM to STEAM – How a Traditionally Run STEM Camp Successfully Incorporated the Arts into its Framework Resulting in a Successful STEAM Camp (Work in Progress),"Transformation of STEM to STEAM – How a traditionally run STEM camp successfully incorporated the ARTS into its framework resulting in a successful STEAM Camp (Work in Progress)The summer of 2014 marked a transition from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)to STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, ARTS, Math) with the incorporation of the Artsinto an existing informal educational model used to enhance K-12 education in an out-of-schoolprogram – a day camp experience for 60 children. This camp infused fun with ART intoengaging activities alongside pointed educational modules to teach 4th-6th grade campers how theSTEAM fields work together to create “Our Beautiful World”; and how they influence themovement towards a more sustainable lifestyle. We operated under the Brundtland Report’sdefinition of sustainability as “development which meets the needs of the present withoutcompromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. Themes ofsustainability and “Our Beautiful World” were incorporated into each of the twelve modules.Modules spanned over four days, and were to be integrated into a final group project- where eachgroup created a balanced community on the template of an island that was provided.Campers were split into six groups of 10; stratified by age. Each group was assigned a color-Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple- and 1-2 camp counselors. Counselors broughttheir group through each day with a provided daily schedule, broken up by time, and module.Module presenters, counselors, and other helpers were recruited chiefly on a volunteer basisfrom faculty, summer research students, local high schools, community partners, and familyfriends. All adults completed a Lafayette background check in order to work with children.To empirically measure the academic success of the camp, campers were given a pre and postsurvey to be completed. Parents and campers gave informed consent with an IRB-approvedform that was collected and kept in a secure location. Each camper was assigned a number towrite in lieu of their name of their pre and post surveys. Pre-surveys were given to all groups atthe start of camp before any modules or activities were completed. Post surveys were given tocampers after all modules and activities were completed, before the final group projectpresentation, where campers explained their group’s overarching project to their parents. Thecampers were also asked to draw a picture of their Beautiful World in relation to STEAM fieldsduring pre-surveys, to be added onto during post surveys in a different color.Intended learner outcomes include an increased cognizance of the environment andsustainability, the role of the Arts in the STEM fields how they can enhance practices,identification of how an individual can change their behavior to live more sustainability, as wellas the identification of how society can change present behaviors to help maintain the planet’slimited supply of resources for future generations.","Kney, Arthur D;McGonigle, Emily Isabelle",10.18260/p.24936,ProQuest
Engineering the Future Workforce Required by a Global Engineering Industry,"Engineering the Future Workforce required by a Global Engineering IndustryThe last decades have brought numerous changes to the engineering workforce. These changeshave been caused both by the increased specialization of skills required by the continuousapplication of innovative technologies and the geopolitical changes enabling global collaborationof engineering design teams. These phenomena, coupled with challenges in the workforcedemographics have created an environment requiring dramatic changes in the way that youth andadolescents in primary, secondary, and post-secondary education are educated to ensure theirfuture career success.While individual teachers have made great strides in improving the learning of their individualstudents to accommodate the requirements of a global workforce in the 21st century overallengineering companies and governmental agencies are challenged by the quantity and quality ofgraduates produced by the education system at all levels. To solve this dilemma a very largeaerospace company and a national space agency have jointly engineered a program inpartnership with educational institutions which prepares students with skills in the Science,Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) areas and does so collaborativelyacross the nation.While the very large aerospace company and governmental space agency have various educationprograms at all levels of the education system, this paper will focus on the joint efforts to engagevarious engineering universities and secondary education institutions across the United States byhaving geographically-dispersed, student teams comprised of members from various universitieswork together to solve an epic engineering challenge. These epic challenges address issues ofglobal concern, e.g., capturing and retrieving an asteroid, monitoring agricultural fields toincrease yield, or assisting first responders, and require a multidisciplinary skill set. This paperwill define the detailed processes required for such a multi-organizational endeavor, rangingfrom the recruitment and organization of partners, to the development of a joint curriculum andexecution of the program. These processes are based on the experiences, by both the very largeaerospace company and governmental space agency, in successfully carrying such multi-stakeholders initiatives within the education systems.While both organizations represented by the authors are aware of the limitations andshortcomings of the current education system, a paradigm change cannot be implementedovernight. This paper will therefor also detail how the jointly engineered program satisfiesABET criteria and will contrast benefits with traditional programs. In addition, a framework willbe presented that will enable the application of these processes to primary and secondaryeducation enabling students to have validated skills that are directly related to national scienceand engineering standards as well as workforce requirements. It is the intention of bothorganizations to leverage their respective technical expertise to engineer a multifunctionalsystems that can provide a workforce based on national objectives and industry requirements.","Richey, Michael;Zender, Fabian;Camarda, Charles J",10.18260/p.23984,ProQuest
Visual Frictions,"The predominant approach in visual studies, explicitly focusing on how vision is socioculturally constructed, tends to neglect the physiological substrate for vision. Images, and our visual surroundings, are often considered from the premise that those dealing with them specifically see with average eyesight and that differences in seeing can be accounted for by cultural and ideological analyses. I set out to question this premise and the normalisation of vision it implies, by drawing on accounts of seeing by Conrad, a friend and colleague who sees with special requirements. His well-articulated verbal description of the requirements involved in his seeing makes it clear that our vision is tightly intertwined with visuality. Our visual surroundings are the way they are partially on account of the ability to see implied. As Conrad puts it, ""they are designed for average eyesight."" I posit that the concept of activated affordances is useful for taking into account that vision is socially constructed, as suggested in important works in visual studies, and that physiological substrates for vision exhibit variation. I will focus particularly on how the designed environment becomes an area for Conrad in which visuality is lived out differently in accordance with how this eyesight happens to manifest itself. Conrad's use of ""social hacks"" provides a case in point for discussing how Conrad activates affordances in unforeseen ways, in order to fulfil desires for socially meaningful action that does not reduce him to stereotypical behaviour when being treated as visually impaired. Maintaining that vision and visuality remain difficult to disentangle, I will argue that we all see with special requirements, even if we might not notice this. For studies of visuality, I suggest reflecting on presumed understandings of vision. The argument in textual form is complemented with a brief video that features an edited interview focusing on Conrad's account of seeing with special requirements. It is supported with visualisations representing an attempt to render aspects of his seeing. Instead of purporting to visualise exactly how he sees, I intend the imagery to provoke reflection of seeing as a complex process, mediated via our ability to see and by the social construction of what to see. 28228_UF0001.jpg Dr. Asko Lehmuskallio is a researcher at the School of Communication, Media and Theatre at the University of Tampere and at Locating Media at the University of Siegen.

More papers from this issue can be found at www.aestheticsandculture.net A short film Seeing with special requirements by Asko Lehmuskallio. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I7c8EHBkhQ&amp;feature=youtu.be The dominant approach in visual studies, explicitly focusing on how vision is socially constructed, tends to neglect the physiological substrate for vision. Studies both of images and of our visual surroundings often proceed from an implicit premise that those dealing with them see with average eyesight and that differences in seeing can be accounted for by cultural and ideological analyses. Here, I question this premise and the normalisation of vision implied, by drawing on accounts of seeing offered by Conrad, a friend and colleague who sees with special requirements. As his eloquent verbalisation of the requirements for seeing makes clear, our vision is closely intertwined with visuality.1 In part, our visual surroundings are the way they are because of the ability to see implied. As Conrad puts it, ""they are designed for average eyesight."" In the discussion that follows, I will focus particularly on how the designed environment becomes an area where visuality is lived out differently depending on the kind of eyesight one happens to have. I wish to argue that we all see with special requirements, and that our requirements linked to seeing differ, depending on our physiological substrate for vision. When attending to designed environments, we situationally adapt to prescribed ways of seeing that are culturally and ideologically formed. I suggest that the concept of activated affordances is helpful for taking into account both the physiological substrate for vision needed for seeing and the cultural and ideological formations that suggest which affordances get activated instead of others.2 The argument in textual form is complemented by a brief video that includes an edited interview focusing on an account of seeing with special requirements. The interview is supported with visualisations intended to render aspects of Conrad's seeing. Instead of claiming to visualise exactly how Conrad sees, I use the imagery to stimulate reflection of seeing as a complex process, mediated via both our ability to see and the social construction of what to see.3 A PARADOX IN VISUAL STUDIES: THE NORMALISATION OF VISION In a well-regarded preface to an edited work on vision and visuality, Hal Foster explains how scopic regimes seek to essentialise vision, naturalising and normalising a certain way to see. He maintains that although vision is based on physiological processes, it is also very much culturally and socially informed. Sight and its techniques intertwine in ways that make them difficult to disentangle, whereas vision and visuality remain woven together.4 Much of the important and influential work published in visual culture studies tends to focus on the latter, the social construction of practices related to vision and visuality, emphasising ways in which power structures, visual orders, scopic regimes, and various gazes direct our attention, our ways of looking, and the meanings that we give to what we see. In doing so, they situate observers, subjects, or bodies within nuanced patterns of power-laden and structured visual interactions.5 These studies explicitly work with the social construction of vision and constitute attempts to uncover asymmetric power structures and to counter them. While doing so, much of this work takes implicitly a particular physiological substrate of vision for granted, although influential figures such as Foster or Mitchell warn against doing so.6 In many of these studies, pictures and the mental images they occasion are deemed so powerful because people can see them. Studies on visual culture seldom reflect from this perspective the premises behind their work; paradoxically, it seems that much of the work explicitly questioning a normalised visuality as socially constructed normalises the physiological substrate of vision.7 I suggest that the concept of activated affordances is useful for understanding the intertwinement of vision and visuality, of how bodies and their environments merge within seeing, helping to point both towards affordances as a relation needed for seeing in the first place and to their activation as a particular cultural form of attention and meaning-making. James J. Gibson coined the term affordance to discuss the complementarity of animals and persons with their environments.8 Affordances, in Gibson's understanding, always describe relations between living beings and their particular environments, and these relations depend both on the living beings and on the environments in question. For example, a small mobile phone screen is perceivable, readable, and therefore usable for text messaging by those with sufficiently good eyesight (for perception and reading) and adequate motor skills (for texting) but not, for example, by many elderly individuals with poor eyesight. The latter can perceive the mobile phone's screen but, because of both poor eyesight and the limited screen size, cannot read it. The mobile phone does not afford them the same kinds of uses it affords others. Gibson's use of the notion of affordance is of assistance for pointing towards the relationality and variety of affordances, but he does not give culturally sensitive explanations addressing why some affordances are preferred over others. For accounting for cultural contextualisations, it is useful to think of activated affordances if one wishes to comprehend the actual use of particular objects, and how their use is embedded in social meanings, as Gillian Rose has proposed in her work on everyday photography.9 The focus on the activation of affordances is useful for pointing to culturally meaningful ways of interacting in visual environments. In Conrad's case, as will be shown later, there is, for example, an explicit activation of coarse-level visual features of friends and colleagues for purposes of identifying them (among these are hair type/style, colour of clothing, and ways of walking), because this kind of activation of affordances is socially meaningful. Being able to identify someone as an individual person is very much encouraged, at least in the so-called Western societies, and, for doing so, some affordances have to be activated rather than others. The affordances available depend, again, not only on the social construction of seeing but also, just as much, on the particular ways in which we are able to see. Conrad's account of the visual frictions encountered in his everyday life is useful for a discussion on how the affordances activated depend both on socially meaningful action and on the physical opportunities for action available to each of us. Mitchell has importantly pointed out that ""[i]t is not just that we see the way we do because we are social animals, but also that our social arrangements take the forms they do because we are seeing animals.""10 Unfortunately for those seeing with special requirements, many social environments continue to be designed with average eyesight in mind. SEEING WITH SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS Conrad provides a good example for a discussion on this possible normalisation of vision and the way in which it rests on particular assumptions about visualities, especially regarding designed environments. Many do not necessarily recognise that Conrad is visually impaired, because he tends to act and talk in ways that do not distinguish him from most others. Although he wears thick eyeglasses, it is not clear to many people that he actually sees very differently than many others do. Whereas he is thus able to ""blend in"" in diverse situations, he does so by activating other affordances than most people with average eyesight do. Where this possibility is not available, he finds that many have a hard time even believing him to need help when he expresses this need. I have many situations in which people don't really realize how much I see, because I have so many tricks, and I hack myself through life somehow. So a lot of times when I tell them I am visually impaired, they sort of don't believe me, and that is a really big problem for me when I try to achieve accessibility or equal behavior, or something like that.11 Conrad has created social hacks, particular activations of affordances that enable him to interact such that his special requirements in seeing are not that readily noticed. These social hacks provide him with a way of rendering his behaviour in front of others so that his actions are not constrained beforehand for reason of his vision. When acting as yet another person who sees as everyone else does, and thereby as someone who is able to navigate built environments and social situations as those with average eyesight do, Conrad allows himself to be drawn into situations that he might not enter if others made judgements in keeping with his impairments in vision. Conrad would not differ from most other people if his visual system were more commonplace. His use of the concept of seeing with special requirements implies that all human beings have particular requirements for their sensory perception and action upon the environment, and that these requirements differ from person to person, just as Gibson suggests with the notion of affordance. As the examples Conrad cites from his life experience make clear, many designed environments are geared towards those with average eyesight, disrupting their use by people with different visual systems. Even everyday utility articles and artefacts such as computers, houses, or cars are often designed for people with normalised, average vision. Conrad points out: [I]f they would be just slightly changed in their designs to meet my requirements, I wouldn't have so many problems actually getting around in the world. If I use the term 'people with special requirements', it always implies that it's not my fault that I can't do this thing at the moment or can't operate this machine or that it takes much longer, but it's actually the fault of the design, because [the problematic element or item] wasn't designed for my requirements but was designed for someone else's requirements. Here, vision and visuality intertwine in ways that show how a variety of designed environments rely on an assumption of average eyesight, a necessary condition for taking up a relation, an affordance, in the first place. Thus, designed artefacts are socially constructed to fit the requirements of particular kinds of people.12 Slight changes in designed environments could enable a better fit between Conrad's body and the material artefacts around him, but designed environments tend to be oriented towards normalised vision rather than allowing for other kinds of activations, such as Conrad's social hacks discussed below.13 Whereas, as Gibson suggests, these differences between individuals may vary significantly, too often there is the tendency to think in discreet binaries, such as normal and special, leading to design decisions that do not take variety into account.14 Acknowledging we all have special requirements in seeing is helpful for deconstructing this binary opposition. FLUID BOUNDARIES OF THE BODY We need a particular physiological substrate for vision if we are to act in environments designed for average eyesight.15 Perhaps, because of the need to adapt to these environments in order to participate in the diverse social interactions presented, devices that allow eyesight that is closer to average eyesight can be felt to be almost as necessary as parts of the body, as is the case with Conrad. Devices modifying our bodies can afford seeing and acting in environments designed for average eyesight: One's body has to be moulded if it is to fit these designed environments. Conrad makes this relation explicit by stating that ""my glasses are not really an object for me; they are more a part of my body like an arm or something like that."" His eyeglasses enable him to partake in meaningful social relations, to activate affordances he would not be able to activate without them. The boundaries of his body are described as not neatly contained but, rather, fluid, such that some material artefacts can be felt to be, in essence, body parts, not that different from an arm or fingers, for example. This understanding provides an example suitable for advancing the thesis of relationality of affordances, particularly addressing how the designed environments we act upon might mould and modify both our bodies and our understandings of them. This fluidity of bodily boundaries becomes understandable when the role of our bodies as a medium for action is underscored, as done in theories of media put forth by John Durham Peters and Hans Belting, among others.16 Our bodies, once moulded, afford novel relations to our environments, a novel fit, and this novel fit might be achieved through glasses, mobile phones, and/or other kinds of artefacts, effectively enabling the distribution and mediation of our selves.17 Action in environments designed for the requirements of average eyesight necessitates media that facilitate it. For some, the physical body itself provides a sufficient medium for doing so, being capable of adapting to the requirements of average eyesight in various environments; however, ever more people need specially fabricated eyewear in order to achieve fit with their environments. There is constant need for spectacles, contact lenses, and other media for being able to see in environments designed for average eyesight. SOCIAL HACKS Although Conrad's glasses feel more like a part of the body for him, he continues to see differently than those who by wearing spectacles approximate normal vision. When using eyeglasses, he must still rely on more prominent features of the people and objects he perceives, thereby explicitly activating affordances that he can rely upon in order to act in a socially meaningful way. Normally, I can't recognise people by their face when they are decently far away, so I use a lot of rough features, like what their body structure looks like, what kind of hairstyle they have, and how they walk. I even try to remember what clothes they wear. It's easy to recognise people by how they walk, because a lot of people walk very distinctively. When they move their upper torso, or even how the body proportions are, how long the legs are and so forth. It all influences how people walk, so this makes it very easy for me to recognise people. [...] I'm very conscious about that. Body movements, colour of clothing, and hairstyle become particularly important since they remain recognisable cues for Conrad. Although those with average eyesight too notice these aspects of those they interact with, this often remains implicit and has to be brought up directly before it is considered, as has been discussed with regard to habitus.18 This friction in fitting within designed environments and social situations whose assumptions rely on average eyesight calls particularly in unfamiliar situations for Conrad's so-called social hacking, a particular way of activating affordances, allowing him to explore novel kinds of relations that enable him to circumvent his special requirements. In social hacking, Conrad activates other affordances than people with average eyesight do, with the intention to approximate a socially accepted behaviour that does not reveal his visual impairment. When I go through the world, one technique that I use is that I always ask people a lot of things if I can't see it or get that information at the moment. So I would even ask indirectly whether something is going on in the street. If I don't see what's going on, I ask people what it is. Ordering food at a restaurant might be such a situation. If it is Conrad's first time at the restaurant and its offerings are not known to him beforehand, Conrad has to rely on a variety of techniques that those with average eyesight do not need. Since he is often unable to read the menu, which where we met (in San Francisco's Bay Area) was often behind the counter, Conrad has to socially hack. Because he cannot identify what is on offer, he has to ask for recommendations, order what someone else is eating or has ordered, just point at some food, or ask about food for special diets (such as vegetarian food). These social hacks circumvent the problem that designed environments do not always afford him the same information that these environments do for those with average eyesight. Many of these social hacks might be used by those with average eyesight as well, but then for other reasons than not being able to read the menu behind the counter. Also, computation devices allow Conrad to gather information about upcoming situations, helping him navigate in environments he cannot see. These devices allow Conrad to plan some of his actions in advance, so that he knows how to act in social situations that entail partial reliance on average eyesight. One of his situational social hacks is to look up the menu of a restaurant on that venue's Web site before going there, so that he knows what is available. The role that these devices receive in Conrad's day-to-day life has become very intimate, since they help him to expand his experiences of the environment, affording him relations he might not engage in without them. As Conrad points out, these devices become a bit like friends, in that they facilitate his every day. They help me a lot, I give an input and the machine replies. All of them actually have a name: my computer, my phone, my Kindle. I name them. They are active, they reply to what I say. Whereas, for Conrad, eyeglasses feel like a part of the body, computation devices end up taking on social roles, since they are even more integral to the many social situations he can navigate with their aid. Both glasses and computation devices enable him to activate affordances in designed environments that otherwise do not fit his requirements. CONCLUSIONS Conrad's account of visual frictions in the course of his everyday life provides a case in point for considering how the physiological substrate for vision and the social construction of visuality are intertwined. The notion of activated affordances is helpful for stressing the relationality between these two with regard to the particular environments under discussion, by enabling particular attention to be paid to why some affordances are activated instead of others. Conrad's use of social hacking is a way to circumvent some of the restrictions he has for activating affordances in environments designed for those with average eyesight. In social hacking, Conrad seeks to activate other affordances in order to act in socially acceptable and meaningful ways, without having to take up the role of being visually impaired. Instead, he can act along with others taking other primary social roles, such as that of a student, an employee, or a young man, for example. For studies in visual culture, this case provides examples for considering both the role of embodied practices and that of material environments for grasping vision and visuality. Presentation of this material in textual form and also as a multimedia narrative allows for the depiction of slightly different readings, which get experienced differently. In line with who the reader or viewer is, this text and the accompanying video afford different kinds of relations, and perhaps some of these might get activated in unforeseen ways. With his eloquent descriptions of how he experiences his surroundings, Conrad reminds me of how we all deal with special requirements, all the time. Vision tests might prove that I see in a manner conforming to the ideals behind these tests, but the test results say little about the variance in seeing that we all experience. Aching, sore eyes after a day at a monitor or when out in the wind; the eyelids closing when one is trying to remain awake; and the assault of brightness after a night in the dark woods all are ways of seeing that entail a need to adapt to designed environments if one wants to take up a relation with them, thus activating an affordance. Acknowledgements This work would not have been possible without Conrad, who patiently and articulately told me about his ways of seeing and let me use his story originally as part of the attached video. In addition, Nancy Van House was particularly helpful in encouraging work on multimedia narrations and gave me the opportunity to follow and take part in the course she was leading at UC Berkeley. I am grateful also for the encouragement I received from friends and colleagues who have seen the video, particularly John Scott and Anna Shefl. Karin Becker was very helpful when I decided to complement the original video with the above text, and various colleagues within the Nordic Network for Digital Visuality have assisted greatly by showing me ways of combining textual and visual work within an academic framework. I would also like to thank colleagues at Locating Media for thoughtful discussions. Notes 1. See also Hal Foster, ""Preface,"" in Vision and Visuality, ed.

VISUAL FRICTIONS Sensory experiences of digital photo-sharing--""mundane frictions"" and emerging learning strategies Vaike Fors* School of Education, Humanities, and Social Sciences, Halmstad University, Sweden Abstract Digital technologies are increasingly ubiquitous in everyday life forming part of the way we live and experience the world. This article will specifically scrutinise how mobile phone cameras, digital photographing and the use of web-based photo-sharing sites and communities become part of the meaning-making practices through which the everyday is lived and understood. In doing so, I advance the concept of ""mundane friction"" through which to discuss the experience, meaning-making and pedagogy generated through operating screen-based technologies. Indeed, media participates in everyday worlds beyond its role as a provider of content and for communication. The question that will be addressed here is how this media presence can be understood from an embodied and sensory perspective, and is based in a study of sensory aspects of teenagers use of web-based photo-diaries. Further, this discussion leads to questions of how an appreciation of digital visuality as more than representational acknowledges the meaning of mundane friction caused by habitually touching, rubbing, clicking, pinching through media technologies as part of the sensory emplacement process that establish people as situated learners. In turn, problematising this tangible friction as pivotal for understanding digital visuality gives reason to argue for research methods that acknowledge digital visual material as more-than-visual and theory that moves toward the unspoken, tacit and sensory elements of learning in everyday practices. Thus, the aim of this article is to elaborate on the embodied, the methodological and the pedagogical dimensions of ""mundane friction"" in meaning-making activities, and its pedagogical implications. 28237_UF0001.jpg Vaike Fors is a teacher and researcher at Halmstad University in Sweden. Her area of expertise lies in the fields of digital, visual and sensory ethnography, with a focus on pedagogical implications of everyday media practices. She has in her pursuit to contribute to further understandings of contemporary conditions for learning, studied museums and teenagers' encounters with museum and science centre exhibits in various research projects.

A Study of Pre-Algebra Learning in the Context of a Computer Game-Making Course,"A Study of Pre-Algebra Learning in the Context of a Computer Game-Making Course Blind SubmissionAbstractIn this paper, we report the outcomes of the first implementation of [a new pre-algebra learningcurriculum based on game design]. The curriculum is the result of a National Science Foundation[program] grant to explore novel ways to teach standards-based content and 21st century skill tounderperforming high school students in Los Angeles. The project’s goals are to addressretention, career education and secondary mathematics learning. Game design is being used toengage students and to provide a grounding context for the mathematics. The effort is meetingthe challenge of teaching math across the curriculum and is leading to the development of newstrategies to embed mathematics in authentic contexts.PedagogyLearning in the context of computer game making is best framed by the philosophy ofConstructionism, which is the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity thelearner experiences as constructing a meaningful product (Papert, 1987; also Kafai, 2008).Following a recent trend in STEM education, the program uses a STEM to STEAM (Science,Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) approach to learning, which is the practice ofintegrating art and/or design with traditional STEM learning to increase interest and impact(Maeda, 2013). The importance of the practice is being recognized at high levels (Bonamici,2013).MethodologyDuring the fall of 2011, fifty students participated in a pilot program to study mathematicslearning in the context of making computer games. During class students created two differentgames – a maze game (e.g. PacMan) and a shooting scroller game (e.g. Space Invaders). Eachgame exercised a different set of mathematical concepts. Game making classes were interspersedwith activities that involved mathematics directly, for example, including doing worksheets andplaying math games; or indirectly, for example, manipulating math concepts that occurred whilemaking games. Students took short self-quizzes after each step of the game making process toreinforce concepts. Pre and post math tests were administered before and after students createdgames. The results of learning gains from pre-test to post-test are reported on here.ResultsData from pre and post tests were analyzed The highest learning gains for the maze gameoccurred in graphing and rates concepts, as well as fractions, percentages and factors. Thehighest for the shooter game occurred in the average, length, percent and probability calculations.[Extra Page for Figures and References]ResultsFigure 1 Maze test (top) and shooter test (bottom) results.

21st Century Community Learning Centers: A Descriptive Evaluation for 2012-2013,"This evaluation study provides descriptive information about the implementation and outcomes of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (CCLC) program in West Virginia, from September 2012 through May 2013. The report draws on information from online surveys of directors of 30 CCLC programs and from school teachers for 4,102 participating students. Most participating students were in the elementary grades. The mean number of days students attended ranged from about 2 to 93 days, depending on the program. Teachers perceived the greatest improvements in participating students' behaviors related to promptness and quality of homework turned in, overall academic performance, and participation in class. Regarding CCLC program volunteers, the largest sources were K-12 service learning programs, parents and faculty members, local businesses, and postsecondary service learning programs. The groups with which program directors reported the greatest level of success were ""other"" (100%) and service learning K-12 (99.7%). Regarding work with partners, the two most frequent types of support received from partners were programming and resources. Partnerships engaged in funding, programming, resources, and training were reported to be the most effective. Regarding professional development, the topics best attended by program directors were programming, STEM/STEAM, and program evaluation. As for parent and community involvement, more than half of program directors indicated they either had no family components in their programs or that they were, at best, well below target goals. Of those who reported success in this area, three main themes emerged as reasons for their successes: (a) the right types of activities; (b) ongoing, even daily contact with parents; and (c) a shared commitment to the program, which involved engaging parents in meaningful work toward program goals. Program directors reported offering more than 600 substance abuse prevention activities, involving more than 7,000 students and nearly 1,600 adults. Nearly three quarters of program directors found the continuous improvement process for after school moderately or very helpful. Likewise, the great majority found the West Virginia Department of Education monitoring visits moderately or very helpful. The following are appended: (1) Teacher Questionnaire; (2) Program Director Questionnaire; and (3) Program Directors' Comments.

Curriculum Exchange: “The Art of Engineering”: a Four-Year Project-Based High School Curriculum,"Curriculum Exchange: “The Art of Engineering”: a Four-Year Project- Based High School CurriculumA teacher who is the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship is implementing a newfour-year project-based STEAM curriculum. The program is designed to give students a real-world, interdisciplinary, project-based approach to learning. The program strives to create abalance between theory and application.The course sequence includes the following dedicated classes: • 9th Grade: Engineering Technology • 10th Grade: Engineering Sculpture and Design • 11th Grade: Engineering Physics • 12th Grade: Advanced Engineering Physics and FIRST Robotics (double-length class)All classes use project-based learning, i.e., the use of classroom projects to facilitate learning andassess student competence. This instructional method provides students with complex tasksbased on challenging questions or problems that involve the students’ problem-solving, decision-making, and investigative skills. Students develop valuable research and design skills. Project-based learning promotes new learning habits that emphasize creative thinking.During their first three years of study, 100 students per grade are enrolled in an integratedproject-based curriculum that collectively covers, in an interdisciplinary fashion, the contentcontained in 1) a standard laboratory science physics course, 2) a standard visual and performingarts sculpture course, and 3) an engineering elective course. These courses are taught by a teamof five teachers, who are credentialed in physics, visual and performing arts, and engineeringtechnology. Content is covered in a completely integrated, interdisciplinary fashion. Thesequence provides credit for a year each of physical science, visual arts, and an elective.Two projects will be presented here: 1) Students construct a hanging mobile. The sculpture has multiple moving parts and is colored to enhance the form. Elements and principles of design include line, shape, color, movement, balance, and space. Students use tools associated with engineering technology such as calipers, and electronic balances. Students calculate the force of gravity acting on each object and calculate all necessary torques and forces for balance. Students fabricate fasteners that allow elements of the mobile to be adjusted during assembly. 2) Students build a programmable light sculpture. The sculpture has a metal housing that is fabricated by the students. The sculpture consists of acrylic rods, which are machined by the students and then mounted in the housing. Students will use soldering irons, build a DC circuit board and wire the components together. The rods are lighted in color from below. The housing contains an Arduino computer that controls the timing and color changes of the sculpture. The students use the open-source Arduino platform to program their light sculpture.","Sandra Hull Seale;Abo-Shaeer, Amir Muhsin",,ProQuest
Softly As I Leave You,"The third of Lokuge's novels after If the Moon Smiled (2000) and Turtle Nest (2003), not including a collection of short fiction, Moth and Other Stories (1992), Softly as I Leave You begins on a slow turgid note as it delineates an unlikable female protagonist, the remarkably self-absorbed Uma presented as a stereotypical exotic beauty with honey skin, lush raven hair and sparkling, come hither eyes that can go from being drenched in love, to being distant and disengaged. [...]despite the clichéd character descriptions that threaten to asphyxiate the narrative at first, the novel gathers steam and tells a compelling story of love, betrayal, and loss as Uma and her devoted husband, Chris, himself a first generation Australian of Italian origins, are forced to confront the loss of their son, Arjun, and find a way to re-connect after long years of a slowly unraveling marriage. [...]Uma's adulterous affair with Liam and her extreme neediness becomes the altar at which the happiness of her family is sacrificed as Arjun, and then Chris, discover this illicit relationship and are shattered.","Kaur, Rajender",,ProQuest
K-12 Bolsters Ties to Engineering,"When science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education is discussed in the K-12 sphere, it often seems like shorthand for mathematics and science, with perhaps a nod to technology and even less, if any, real attention to engineering. But recent developments signal that the ""e"" in STEM may be gaining a firmer foothold at the precollegiate level. For one, a new, national assessment in technology and engineering literacy will be administered to 8th graders next year by the makers of ""the nation's report card"" on education. Also, engineering design is threaded through a set of ""next generation"" science standards nearing completion by a coalition of experts and 26 states. And the first-ever Advanced Placement program in engineering may be on the horizon, as efforts to create one appear to be building steam.","Robelen, Erik W.",,ProQuest
"UMES STEM Faculty, Students, and Staff Collaborate to Address Contemporary Issues Related to Energy, Environment, and Sustainable Agriculture","UMES STEM FACULTY, STUDENTS, AND STAFF COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS CONTEMPORARY ISSUES RELATED TO ENERGY, ENVIRONMENT, AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTUREAbstract“The Bio-Fuel, Sustainability, and Geospatial Information Technologies to Enhance ExperientialLearning Paradigm for Precision Agriculture Project”, recently funded by the United StatesDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) extends the environmental stewardship archetype of thepreceding project titled “Environmentally Conscious Precision Agriculture: A Platform for ActiveLearning and Community Engagement” (completed in September 2011). The initial phase of theproject to demonstrate the production of biodiesel using waste vegetable oil (WVO) from campusdining services has been successfully executed by UMES student team. Under the supervision ofthe project leaders, the students have worked in teams to collect, dewater, and filter the WVO;supported the acquisition of supplies and installation of the biodiesel processor; performednecessary titration and laboratory tests on the WVO to determine appropriate amounts ofchemicals ( sodium hydroxide, methanol, and sulfuric acid) to be used with a batch of WVO inthe processor for the esterification and transesterification reactions; and operated and monitoredthe 48 hour biodiesel production and washing cycle of the processor. Besides biodiesel theprocess produces glycerin as byproduct. The glycerin has been used to produce soap successfullyby the students. Students have also tested ‘gelling’ tendency of different blends of biodiesel andare currently working with the UMES farm manager to identify and appropriately modify farmequipment for biodiesel use. Students are also working with the university safety office to refinesafety considerations to comply with OSHA and municipality requirements. Students will beinvolved in managing broader logistics of scheduling the processor operation for biodieselproduction and utilization, based on needs of the farm equipment. The project team plans torefine the processing of glycerin by-product to improve the aesthetics, fragrance, and otherqualitative parameters of the soap so that they may sell it for possible fund-raising efforts forselected student organizations.The project leaders have encouraged all “STEAM” (science, technology, engineering, agriculture,and mathematics) majors to participate in the ongoing efforts and are exploring involvement ofinterested business, human ecology, and fine-arts students to address some of the new dimensionsof the project. Maryland Space Grant Consortium has provided supplementary support forinterested undergraduate students, particularly from the underserved population to get involved.The broader scope of the project includes use of biodiesel, a carbon neutral energy source, for usewith farm equipment and as an alternative transportation fuel to address climate change andsustainable energy related issues. Furthermore, the project will continue to address use of remotesensing and advanced geospatial information technology tools to optimize use of nutrients, water,and other resources for efficient production agriculture practices that are critical to provide foodfor a growing population on the planet in a sustainable fashion.","Nagchaudhuri, Abhijit;Mitra, Madhumi;Teays, Terry John;Daughtry, Craig S T;Schwarz, Jurgen G;Marsh, Lurline",,ProQuest
Restoring a Classic Electric Car,"One hundred years ago, automobiles were powered by steam, electricity, or internal combustion. Female drivers favored electric cars because, unlike early internal-combustion vehicles, they did not require a crank for starting. Nonetheless, internal-combustion vehicles came to dominate the industry and it's only in recent years that the electrics have gotten more attention. In this article, the author describes how he restored a 1981 Mercury Lynx that had been converted by Jet Industries to function as a plug-in electric vehicle.","Kraft, Thomas E.",,ProQuest
A Place for Art and Design Education in the STEM Conversation,"The recent push for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education introduces (through the emphasis on engineering) a ""design process"" to science classrooms; some educators have also pushed for the ""artistic or creative process"" becoming a part of STEM education. In certain cases, this might be an opportunity for greater prominence for art education, better art and STEM learning, and heightened student engagement; in others it might weaken each discipline and confuse the boundaries between different approaches. In what follows we describe the possibilities and pitfalls of an approach that infuses both the creative process and design thinking into a new iteration of STEM education that adds arts (with a capital ""A"") to the acronym to make STEAM.

Getting to 2014: The Choices and Challenges Ahead,"Over the next few years, educators and policymakers have committed to implementing an array of challenging, but potentially transformative, reforms--reforms that could go beyond rearranging furniture to fundamentally restructuring and improving teaching and learning. Facing this much simultaneous change would be difficult even without the possibility that some of these changes may be in conflict--a proverbial iceberg in the path of reform. Collisions are more likely to happen when policymakers and educators plow full steam ahead, failing to look across the spectrum of reform and consider how each change affects the others. Thus, those overseeing these efforts must consider how multiple changes look when implemented together at the same time. If they don't, collisions could sink the opportunity to get school reform right. But if they do, they can anticipate challenges, make smart policy choices, and navigate the trade-offs that naturally follow. In this collection of essays, contributors discuss five of these dilemmas: (1) How do we successfully implement new accountability systems and interventions during the transition to new standards and assessments?; (2) How do we maintain the rigor of college- and career-ready standards without pushing more students out of the system?; (3) How do we adopt fair teacher evaluation systems based on student assessments when those assessments are set to change?; (4) How do we move toward more standardization while also promoting innovation?; and (5) How can we execute multiple, complex reforms in a time of limited resources? These are true dilemmas, without right-or-wrong answers. Thus, it is hoped that these essays provide a forum for provocative ideas: ideas that may not be particularly comfortable or comforting, but are nonetheless worthy of debate as policymakers, practitioners, and educators begin to tackle these challenges. Essays included in this volume are: (1) Getting Accountability and Implementation Right (Michael Cohen); (2) Doing It All: Raising Graduation Rates and Standards (Robert Balfanz); (3) Taking the Long-Term View on Teacher Evaluation (Bill Tucker); (4) Leaping Forward Without Holding Schools Back (Bryan C.

This new analysis of National Assessment of Educational Progress scores--focusing on Texas and on the entire nation--by former National Center for Education Statistics commissioner Mark Schneider finds that solid gains in math achievement coincided with the advent of ""consequential accountability,"" first in the trailblazing Lone Star State and a few other pioneer states, then across the land with the implementation of NCLB. But Schneider warns that the recent plateau in Texas math scores may foreshadow a coming stagnation in the country's performance.

Time Keeping Experiments For A Mechanical Engineering Education Laboratory Sequence,"The evolution of science and technology throughout history parallels the development of time keeping devices which assist mankind in measuring and coordinating their daily schedules. The earliest clocks used the natural behavior of the sun, sand, and water to approximate fixed time intervals. In the medieval period, mechanical clocks were introduced that were driven by weights and springs which offered greater time accuracy due to improved design and materials. In the last century, electric motor driven clocks and digital circuits have allowed for widespread distribution of clock devices to many homes and individuals. In this paper, a series of eight laboratory experiments have been created which use a time keeping theme to introduce basic mechanical and electrical engineering concepts, while offering the opportunity to weave societal implications into the discussions. These bench top and numerical studies include clock movements, pendulums, vibration and acoustic analysis, material properties, circuit breadboards, microprocessor programming, computer simulation, and artistic water clocks. For each experiment, the learning objectives, equipment and materials, and laboratory procedures are listed. To determine the learning effectiveness of each experiment, an assessment tool will be used to gather student feedback for laboratory improvement. Finally, these experiments can also be integrated into academic programs that emphasize science, technology, engineering and mathematical concepts within a societal context. 1.0 Introduction The common clock, whether mechanical, electric or electronic, represents a dynamic system whose precision and sophistication has evolved with society as well as the interpretation of time. A clock generally contains a host of scientific and engineering principles which make them an ideal system for study by students since they represent practical real world applications. The span of clock technology includes physics (pendulums), fluids (water, sand), metallurgy (springs, cases), mechanisms (gear trains, levers), thermodynamics (air or Atmos clock), feedback control (escapement), mathematics (harmonic motion), electric motors, electronics (clock chip), computer programming (digital clock), and radioactive decay (atomic clock). Time keeping devices fulfill an important societal by allowing the coordination of personal, commerce, and transportation activities. It has been suggested by Mumford1 that “the clock, not the steam engine, is the key machine of the modern industrial age”. Given the familiarity and general knowledge of clocks by students and people of all ages, these time keeping devices represent an ideal medium for engineering discovery and creativity through focused laboratory experiments. A short review of selected mechanical engineering education laboratories and clock learning materials will be presented. Knight and McDonald2 discussed the senior level mechanical engineering laboratory at the University of Tennessee which seeks to balance mechanical and thermal system experiments. The identification of learning objectives within the mechanical engineering laboratory sequence at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology has been addressed by Layton et al.3.

National Standards Gain Steam: Governors' Embrace Rooted in Competitiveness Concerns,"This article reports that the National standards--once the untouchable ""third rail"" of American education policy--now have the backing of the nation's governors, a growing number of education leaders, and the U.S. secretary of education.

The governors join several education groups--the Council of the Great City Schools, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and the American Federation of Teachers among them--in endorsing the idea that the nation should set a common definition of what students should know and be able to do.","Hoff, David J.",,ProQuest
Combined Steady-State and Dynamic Heat Exchanger Experiment,"This paper describes a heat-transfer experiment that combines steady-state analysis and dynamic control. A process-water stream is circulated through two tube-in-shell heat exchangers in series. In the first, the process water is heated by steam. In the second, it is cooled by cooling water. The equipment is pilot-plant size: heat-transfer areas of 0.542 and 2.96 m2 and process-water flowrates up to 65 kg/min. The steady-state analysis involves checking energy balances around both hot and cold sides of both heat exchangers after measurements of flowrates, temperatures and pressures have been made. Redundant temperature measurements that do not give exactly the same values require the students to consider data reconciliation methods to ensure theoretically consistent energy balances. Overall heat-transfer coefficients are calculated for both heat exchangers over a range of process-water flowrates. Wilson plots are constructed to determine inside film coefficients, which are compared with predictions of applicable correlations. The dynamic analysis involves step and relay-feedback tests to determine experimental dynamic information for the system. There are two temperature controllers. The first controls the temperature of the process water leaving the heater by manipulating the steam flowrate. The second controls the temperature of the process water leaving the cooler by manipulating the cooling-water flowrate. The dynamic performances of various controller tuning methods are evaluated. Experimental dynamics are compared with dynamic simulations using Aspen Dynamics.","Luyben, William L.;Tuzla, Kemal;Bader, Paul N.",,ProQuest
Utilizing Design Sheets In The Design Of Energy And Thermal Systems,"In designing an energy system such as a steam power plant or a solar water heating system, an engineer is required to select and size many different components such as pumps, turbines, and solar panels. Proper selection and sizing of these components require understanding of materials covered in basic engineering science courses such as thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics. Moreover, the engineer must have knowledge and understanding of the overall system, the role of each component in the system design, and the interactions among different components. In addition, the selection and sizing process must conform to and follow industry standards and recommendations. As a result, many manufacturers provide design sheets to facilitate the design and selection process of their products. Even though the use of design sheet is prevalent in industry, many engineering textbooks in thermal/fluid sciences do not include or even describe them. This paper provides descriptions of some design sheets relevant to design of thermal and energy systems, and how they can be used in courses such as fluid mechanics, design of thermal systems, energy engineering, and energy conversion systems. For a practicing engineer in industry, it is common practice to be asked to choose or select a component to replace or upgrade an existing system. As an example, an engineer is asked to replace a pump supplying make-up water to the cooling tower in order to increase the flow rate of the make-up water supply. The engineer will need to evaluate several pumps in order to meet the flow rate required as well as other considerations such as size and cost of the pump, pressure drop in the piping system that the pump needs to overcome, selection of a motor to drive the pump, etc. The selection of pump will be commonly done using the design sheet or selection procedure provided by the manufacturer of the pump. The situation is similar for an engineer designing an energy or thermal system such as a solar water heating system. He/she is required to select solar panels, one or more water storage tanks, a pump, and other items such as a temperature controller, valves, piping, etc for the system in question. Proper selection and sizing of these components require understanding of materials covered in basic engineering science courses such as thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics. Moreover, the engineer must have a thorough knowledge and understanding of the overall system, the role of each component in the system design, and the interactions among different components. In addition, the selection and sizing process must conform to and follow industry codes, standards, and recommendations. As a result, many manufacturers provide design sheets to facilitate the design and selection process of their products. Even though the use of design sheets is prevalent in industry, many engineering textbooks in thermal/fluid sciences do not include or even describe them. In the author’s opinion, it is important for students to learn the use of design sheets as it",Kendrick Aung,,ProQuest
Using A Delphi Study To Define A Curriculum For Service Systems Engineering,"The U.S. economy has gradually changed from one based in agriculture, to one focused on manufacturing, to one now that relies heavily on the service sector. The service sector, including governmental agencies, retail stores, the entertainment business, public utilities, and providers of similar services, now makes up more than 80% of the total U.S. economy. Engineering programs, which typically have their roots in the era of manufacturing, have a focus on the design and fabrication of “products” rather than the design and creation of service systems. While curricula such as engineering management and industrial engineering provide some support to service systems engineering, their legacies are tied to the manufacturing sector, and as a result, they are not optimized to support the service sector. With this in mind, a Delphi Study was performed to identify the features, characteristics, and topics relevant to a service systems engineering curriculum. This paper describes the planning, conduct, and results of the service systems engineering Delphi Study and how this information is being used to establish a new degree program. The modern-day engineering profession has its origin in the 14th century when individuals such as Leonardo daVinci were hired to design better weapons or better defenses, depending on the client.3 Early engineers were engaged in the art of war – building better roads, bridges, and sanitation systems. Soon, the civilian population demanded luxuries such as those afforded the army, giving birth to civil engineering. With the dawn of the Industrial Age, mechanical engineering evolved to feed the need for individuals who could design and build efficient steam- powered machinery. Electrical and chemical engineering soon followed as the standard of living continued to improve in the developed world. Engineering disciplines have continuously evolved throughout history, giving birth to disciplines such as biomedical, computer, and aerospace. Throughout its long history, however, the engineering profession has been clearly focused on designing better devices, mechanisms, objects, and the processes used to realize these articles. At the same time the engineering profession evolved to meet the needs of society, the economic basis for society also changed dramatically, due in large part to the technological advances that were developed. Two hundred years ago, the economy was primarily based on agricultural production. Manufacturing superceded agriculture in terms of size, employment, and importance during the twentieth century. Today’s economy is based largely upon the service sector, with the service sector now accounting for nearly 80% of all economic activity in the U.S., far “Proceedings of the 2005 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Copyright © 2005, American Society for Engineering Education”","Drummer, Thomas;Frendewey, James;Sorby, Sheryl;Mattila, Kris;Sutherland, John;Bohmann, Leonard",,ProQuest

Modeling Geyser Eruptions in the Classroom,"Watching Old Faithful transform from a smoldering mound to an explosive 50-meter high geyser is enough to generate awe in any observer.

Biologists have recently recognized thermal features as a habitat of interesting bacteria that thrive in extreme conditions and may provide clues to the origin of life. Engineers tap into the steam and hot water found in thermal areas around the Pacific Rim to generate electricity without releasing the carbon dioxide associated with fossil fuels. Geysers provide an excellent opportunity to explore the Earth system as described by the National Science Education Standards (content standard D for grades 5?8). By using the geyser model activity described in this article, students can investigate the relationship between the hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere.

This is a less popular standpoint, and we shall show in this paper that there exist engineering ancestors in some very pure mathematics, and that interrelation is a constant between technological and scientific areas. In particular, we track the ancestors of fractal geometry and chaos up to the development of steam technologies in the 18th century.

Wireless Drop Tower for Microgravity Demonstrations. Educational Brief,"Microgravity-the absence or reduction of some of the effects of gravity-is an important attribute of free-fall. In microgravity (often incorrectly called zero-g), water no longer flows ""downhill"" and neither do smoke or steam bubbles rise. This changes a number of chemical and physical activities. Experiments in combustion, fluid behavior, materials formation, cell science, and even fundamental physics formed an important part of the research conducted aboard the Space Shuttle in the 1980s and '90s. This educational brief for grades 9-12 provides assembly instructions for constructing a mini drop tower. The drop tower holds demonstration payloads such as a postage scale, a birthday candle, and an oil-drop toy. (MVL)",,,ProQuest
Development Of A Method To Fully Assess The Environmental Costs Of Electrical Energy Generation By Nuclear Power Plants,"A major problem affecting the assessment of the environmental and social costs of energy in addition to the monetary cost is a lack of standardization of assessment techniques which makes comparisons difficult or invalid. The University of Florida has adopted the EMERGY analysis process developed by Howard T. Odum1,2,3 to perform a self-consistent study of energy production to assess the full range of environmental, social and economic costs. The EMERGY analysis makes the ordering of energy values and the assignment of energy units (emjoules) to environmental and economic costs possible. The need for such a study arises from Federal directives for utilities to more fully assess the environmental and social costs of electricity production. The University of Florida has completed an implementable EMERGY analysis of a nuclear power plant that meets the spirit of the Federal directive. The development of the EMERGY analysis can serve as an example for utilities to follow in the future in their assessment of environmental and social costs. The reported study analyzes the integrated economic, energy, and environmental costs involved in the construction, maintainance, operation, and decommissioning of a steam nuclear power electric generating facility. Data were collected or calculated on the energy, economic, and environmental costs (emergy inputs) associated with the construction, operation, and decommissioning of a 1000 MW e nuclear power plant. These total energy cost data were analyzed and compared to the electrical output of the same size plant utilizing different fuel sources. The study shows that relatively low amounts of energy, economic, and environmental costs (in emergy units) are required to produce a given amount of electricity from the nuclear power plant compared to other electricity production options. The energy analysis employed in this study was an EMERGY analysis. The EMERGY concept is an accounting system or language that allows comparisons to be made between different energy systems or subsystems. An EMERGY analysis accounts for environmental and economic effects as well as direct energy and material use in a defined system. Each material, monetary quantity, or energy source is assigned an emergy value (in emjoules or sej's) based on how much solar energy it took to create it. The EMERGY inputs into the system under study are summed and divided into the energy output. The result is a ratio (EMERGY yield ratio), which indicates the efficiency and environmental impact within the system. This study yielded a ratio of 8.45 for a 1000 MWe nuclear power plant. Previous studies showed a ratio of 2.5 for coal, 0.48 for solar and 0.25 for wind Main Menu","Simpson, Robert;Hintenlang, David;Tulenko, James",,ProQuest
The Evolution Of An Energy Conversion Course At The United States Military Academy,"Over the past several years, an energy conversion course offered by the Mechanical Engineering Program at West Point has evolved into a cohesive series of lessons addressing three general topical areas: advanced thermodynamics, advanced mechanical system analysis, and direct energy conversion systems. Mechanical engineering majors enroll in Energy Conversion Systems (ME 472) during the fall semester of their senior year as an advanced elective. ME 472 builds directly on the material covered in Thermodynamics (EM 301) taken during the student’s junior year. In the first segment of ME 472, the students study advanced thermodynamic topics including exergy and combustion analyses. The students then analyze various mechanical systems including refrigeration systems, internal combustion engines, boilers, and fossil fuel-fired steam and gas turbine combined power plants. Exergetic efficiencies of various equipment and systems are determined. The final portion of the course covers direct energy conversion technology, including fuel cells, photovoltaics, thermoelectricity, thermionics, and magnetohydrodynamics. Supplemental lessons on energy storage, semi-conductors, and nonreactive energy sources (such as solar collectors, wind turbines, and hydroelectric plants) are included here. This paper discusses the evolution of ME 472 over the past several years and explains the motivations for the course’s progress. I. Introduction The United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point is the oldest engineering institution in the nation, having taught engineering science and design to students of military art since 1802. The Academy’s overarching general educational goal is “To enable its graduates to anticipate and to respond effectively to the uncertainties of a changing technological, social, political and economic world”. 1 The mission of the USMA is: “to educate, train, and inspire the Corps of Cadets so that each graduate is a commissioned leader of character committed to the values of Duty, Honor, Country; professional growth throughout a career as an officer in the United States Army; and a lifetime of selfless service to the nation.”1 Proceedings of the 2002 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Copyright © 2002, American Society for Engineering Education Main Menu","Bailey, Margaret;Ozer Arnas",,ProQuest
New Models and Metaphors for Human Resource Development,"This document contains two reports from a poster session on new ideas and models in human resource development (HRD). The first presentation, ""Two-way Customer-Service Provider Cycle"" (Harriet V. Lawrence, Albert K. Wiswell), discusses a two-way supply cycle model that illustrates relational issues in customer service, including needs and wants, expectations, quality, timeliness, cost, requirements, discrepancies, and feedback. The second paper describes a session titled ""Using Art to Explore a Metaphor for the Training Process"" (Darren Short), in which the poster offered the visual metaphor of the transition of ice to water to steam for the potential effects of the training process on individuals. Conference attendees were invited to interpret the metaphor in light of their own human resource development experiences with employee training. (KC)",,,ProQuest
"The Three-Year (1995-1997) Workplace Literacy Program at Chinatown Manpower Project, Inc. Final Evaluation","An external evaluation was conducted of the Workplace Literacy Program at Chinatown Manpower Project, Inc., which provided oral and written job-specific instruction in English as a second language to Chinese garment workers. The program was designed for underemployed garment industry workers with low English proficiency, including seamstresses, steam pressers, button-hole makers, hem operators, finishers, sample makers, markers and cutters, forepersons, and office workers. Data collection procedures consisted of face-to-face and telephone interviews with project administration and staff, class observations, face-to-face student interviews, student files, and a review of project materials. Findings indicated the following: 551 students were trained onsite during the 3-year funding period; thousands were actively involved in radio and television broadcast training, as shown by their submitting activities and exams from the accompanying materials by mail to CMP; and the program developed 100 radio broadcast lessons available on audiotapes with 2 companion booklets; 27 television broadcast lessons available on videotape with accompanying materials; 6 computer lessons with instruction booklets; curriculum guide; classroom visual aids; and assessment instruments.

Geothermal Energy: Resource and Utilization. A Teaching Module,"The search for new energy resources as alternatives to fossil fuels have generated new interest in the heat of the earth itself. New geothermal areas with a variety of characteristics are being explored, as are new ways of extracting work from naturally heated steam and hot water. Some of this effort is discussed in this three-part module. Five types of geothermal resources and their development and utilization are reviewed in the first section. Geothermal energy and related principles are discussed in the second section. These include: force, work, energy, power; absolute temperature and pressure; heat engines, carnot engine; enthalpy; and availability and maximum work. Geothermal energy utilization is discussed in the third section, focusing on electricity generated from and non-electrical applications of geothermal energy.

"Celestial calendar-paintings and culture-based digital storytelling: cross-cultural, interdisciplinary, STEM/STEAM resources for authentic astronomy education engagement","In D(L)akota star knowledge, the Sun is known as Wi and the Moon is Han-Wi. They have an important relationship, husband and wife. The pattern of their ever-changing relationship is mirrored in the motions of Sun and Moon as seen from our backyards, also called the lunar phases. The framework of the cultural teaching is storytelling and relationships. Cultural perspectives in astronomy such as this remind us of how indigenous ways of knowing are rooted in inclusion, engagement, and relevancy. Designed by A. Lee in 2007, the Native Skywatchers initiative seeks to remember and revitalize indigenous star and earth knowledge, promoting the native voice as the lead voice. The overarching goal of Native Skywatchers is to communicate the knowledge that indigenous people traditionally practiced a sustainable way of living and sustainable engineering through a living and participatory relationship with the above and below, sky and earth. In 2012 two indigenous star maps were created: the Ojibwe Giizhig Anung Masinaaigan-Ojibwe Sky Star Map (A. Lee, W. Wilson, C. Gawboy), and the D(L) akota star map, Makoce Wicanhpi Wowapi (A. Lee, J. Rock). In 2016, a collaboration with W. Buck of the Manitoba First Nations Resource Centre (MFNRC), produced a third star map: Ininew Achakos Masinikan-Cree Star Map Book. We aim to improve current inequities in education for native young people especially through STEM engagement, to inspire increased cultural pride, and promote community wellness. Presented here will be recently created resources such as: astronomical calendar-paintings and short videos that exist at the intersection of art-science-culture. As we look for sustainable ways to widen participation in STEM, particularly in astronomy education, part of the conversation needs to consider the place for art and culture in STEM.","Lee, AS; Wilson, W; Tibbetts, J; Gawboy, C; Meyer, A; Buck, W; Knutson-Kolodzne, J; Pantalony, D",10.1051/epjconf/201920001002,WOS
STEAM-Learning to Mars: Students' Ideas of Space Research,"Multidisciplinarity and the enrichment of science and mathematics education toward the so-called STEAM-approach where the A stands for art, has raised a lot of academic interest in the past decade. In this study, 5th and 6th graders from the greater Helsinki area (N = 390) participated in a several months long, Mars-colonization themed STEAM-learning intervention. Testing the students' science knowledge using pre- and post-tests, their learning outcomes were compared to those of 5th and 6th graders from a control school (N = 119), who during the same period studied STEM-subjects in a more traditional manner. The main factors that were taken into account during the comparisons were gender and academic achievement level. Based on only whether there was any improvement between the pre- and post-test scores, girls were found to have benefitted from the Mars-module more than boys did. While also considering the magnitude of the said improvement, no significant difference in the effectiveness of the learning module was found between genders. The group of academically highest-achieving students improved their test scores the most after participating in the STEAM-learning module. This is an important, somewhat surprising finding, as often informal, outside of school learning has been found to benefit especially students with lower grade point averages.","Piila, E; Salmi, H; Thuneberg, H",10.3390/educsci11030122,WOS
"Lasers, penguins, and polar bears: Novel outreach and education approaches for NASA's ICESat-2 mission","NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2), to be launched in 2018, will measure the height of Earth from space using lasers, collecting the most precise and detailed account yet of our planet's elevation. The mission will allow scientists to investigate how global warming is changing the planet's icy polar regions and to take stock of Earth's vegetation. ICESat-2's emphasis on polar ice, as well as its unique measurement approach, will provide an intriguing and accessible focus for the mission's education and outreach programs. Sea ice and land ice are areas that have experienced significant change in recent years. It is key to communicate why we are measuring these areas and their importance. ICESat-2 science data will provide much-needed answers to climate change questions such as, Is the ice really melting in the polar regions? and What does studying Earth's frozen regions tell us about our changing climate?

Modeling and Simulation of a Satellite Training Kit for Providing Space Systems Engineering Knowledge and Technological Development in STEAM,"Aerospace Engineering is an emerging division of modern engineering nowadays. Many space programs have been taken lately at the graduate and post-graduate levels to familiarize the topic to the students. As a result, space technological knowledge and research have been limited to postgraduate and doctorate students. Undergraduate, college and school students do not get proper access to space-related knowledge. Moreover, nowadays small satellites are very popular for educational and research purposes as big satellites are costly and too complex for starters. For school and college students, it is very hard to understand the system and functions of satellites due to the limitation of space system knowledge. There are some satellite training kits in the market that can help the students to understand the systems and structure of a satellite. However, the few available satellite training kits are very much expensive. The demonstration of such a satellite training kit with a proper program can eradicate the limitation of the availability of space education and keep growing interest among the students about satellite technology. In this thesis project, a systematic architecture has been proposed that can provide the students with space systems engineering experience through demonstration, assembly, integration, and operation of a satellite training kit. The whole architecture has four parts 1) Simulation, 2) Mechanical, 3) Electrical, and 4) Software. In this thesis, to prove our whole concept we will complete the mechanical and electrical simulations of the satellite training kit.","Bhuiyan, MKB; Islam, MS; Sanvi, TI; Talukder, MJH; Antara, RSI; Azad, AKMAM",10.1109/IEACON51066.2021.9654632,WOS
From STEM to STEAM: Towards Aerospace Partnerships with Cultural Heritage Diagnostics,"What would happen if archaeology and aerospace joined forces to test and develop new technology? Not only would it be the basis for an epic movie, there is considerable need in emerging fields of archaeology, like cultural heritage diagnostics, where a fruitful partnership could be forged. Both cultural heritage diagnostics and engineering groups share needs for multi-dimensional and multi-spectral surveying, immersive collaboration environments for visualizing results for analytics, and layered reality annotation systems to engage the scientific community and capture crowd-sourced feedback. The University of California, San Diego (UCSD) hosts the Center of Interdisciplinary Science for Art, Architecture, and Archaeology (CISA3), which is focused on engineering and adapting technology towards cultural heritage diagnostics for these purposes. CISA3 would like to build and consolidate new bridges between industry, academia, and government research to develop, test, and explain new tools to explore the cultural world around us with systems typically dreamt of in science fiction space exploration. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education and research is highly lauded as a means to maintain and improve society's problem-solving prowess. Recent years have seen a movement to put the Arts into the middle of STEM, thus transforming it into STEAM, to foster innovation and to deliver comprehensive, sustainable solutions to a wide range of problems and opportunities, especially those that are culturally sensitive. Utilizing this emphasis on an expanded definition of the 'arts' - specifically art, architecture, and archaeology a la CISA could help the aerospace industry and its many offshoots by both providing a culturally accessible entry point to engage the masses to recruit new generations of Indiana-Jones space exploration-engineers and act as a test bed for equipment and training. Deeper collaborations with aerospace offer cultural heritage diagnostics the chance to extend its ongoing dialogue between those who can identify practical field problems for which technology has not yet been invented, like archaeologists and art historians, and the computer scientists and engineers who are capable of constructing solutions. This paper explores ways that cultural heritage diagnostics with CISA3 and similar organizations bridge the gap between pure and applied science in turn smudging the lines between the hard and soft sciences. It will explore the ways in which a STEAM movement focused not just on arts, but on art, architecture, and archaeology may be the path towards the productive and innovative collaborations between academia, industry, and government which have long been dreamed of, but not yet fully achieved. This paper will suggest ways in which cultural heritage diagnostics entities might partner with the aerospace industry to evolve well-rounded tools that reveal and preserve the treasure of our past to present audiences - to inspire and enable a future for humankind on and beyond planet Earth.","Richter, AM; Petrovic, V; Kuester, F; Seracini, M; Angelo, R",,WOS
Federal STEM Policy and Politics and Their Impact on Astronomy EPO: Reflections and Provocations,"The federal government invests more than $3 billion each year across its various units in supporting STEM education and outreach. Efforts in recent years to understand and better coordinate these investments have resulted in considerable push back, particularly those efforts that aimed at consolidation and elimination of programs deemed ineffective or duplicative. While initial plans to streamline federal STEM education were defeated, many agencies nonetheless saw cuts and elimination, and a high-level effort to coordinate STEM education at the cross-agency level is now gaining steam (CoSTEM: Committee on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education). What do all of these developments mean for education and public outreach in astronomy and related fields? How should this community operate within the opportunities and threats that CoSTEM might pose? Former director of the National Academy of Science's Board on Science Education, and now director of the Center for Research on Lifelong STEM Learning, Martin Storksdieck, reflected on past and recent developments from the perspective of a close observer, and from the perspective of someone who has been involved in astronomy education research and evaluation for nearly 20 years. Shelley Canright, Senior Advisor for Education Integration at the NASA Office of Education, shared her insights and perspectives with respect to CoSTEM and EPO, in particular from co-chairing the Federal Coordination in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (FC-STEM) group.","Schultz, G; Storksdieck, M; Canright, S",,WOS
Is there deep learning on Mars? STEAM education in an inquiry-based out-of-school setting,"Learning intervention based on a Mars and Space exhibition was designed according to STEAM-education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) principles and practices in order to bridge the gap between formal and informal learning. The cognitive learning of 12-year-old students in Finland (N = 306) showed a sustained level for a six months period. The results of this study provided evidence that situational motivation was enhanced by interest in school science in the STEAM science exhibition context. This led to better cognitive learning results in the post-knowledge test. Thus, interest and situational motivation were the first steps, and the superficial situational motivation seemed to successfully change into content-based intrinsic motivation with longer-lasting, deep learning outcomes. STEAM intervention apparently produced long-term learning, and this exhibition learning setting is shown to provide an appropriate platform to reach the deeper layers to successfully retain knowledge. Boys' scores rose even in the delayed test. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) to assess the effects on individual, motivational and situational interest in learning, situation motivation is shown to work as a catalyst and acting as a catalyst and also acted as a stepping stone for intrinsic motivation as part of relative autonomy (RAI) and a deep learning strategy.","Salmi, HS; Thuneberg, H; Bogner, FX",10.1080/10494820.2020.1823856,WOS

The heat transformer is driven directly by heat from a solar collector. The performance for different three drying periods and a number of factors affecting it were predicted by a computer simulation. Furthermore the heat and mass transfer characteristics of water evaporation into superheated steam stream by radiative and convective heating were indicated experimentally. It was concluded that the system would be useful for industries where high temperature(over 100-degrees-C) drying is required.","NOMURA, T; NISHIMURA, N",10.1080/07373939208916470,WOS
STEAM EDUCATION ON GALILEO'S TELESCOPE: ART SCAFFOLDS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION,"STEAM education is an interdisciplinary approach to scientific disciplines that highlights the high dose of creativity and imagination shared by fields such as science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics. This communication explores an innovative approach for science education through art, which provides a valuable complementary historical context for the history of science. The innovation of this approach stems from the use of artworks (painting, graphics, etc.) for teaching science, whose accessibility and simplicity might amplify and complement the students' motivation and attraction toward science. Further, the approach integrates science and humanities, thus contributing to close this gap, through starting a complementary teaching cooperation between art (humanities) and science teachers. The innovative approach is contextualized here within the case of Galileo's telescope, which also provides interesting additional issues on the nature of science, such as the relationships between science and technology (scientific instrumentation) and the general interactions among science, technology and society, which also lie at the social interface of art and science. This contribution highlights the role of art as a faithful witness at the dawn of science: artistic iconography on scientific themes disseminates scientific knowledge and demonstrates the link between science and art throughout history, and more extensively the pervasive science, technology and society interactions. Some contemporary paintings, drawings and pictures centered on Galileo's science and telescopes are presented. In addition, art can act as a motivational factor on students' science learning and contribute to historically situate better some scientific facts. Summing up, the basic ideas of this proposal about emphasizing science through art are contributing to better science learning, closing the science-humanities gap, and teaching issues of the nature of science, which are put into play through the cooperation between science and art teachers across issues and times.","Vázquez-Manassero, MA; Manassero-Mas, MA; Vázquez-Alonso, A",,WOS
A SOLAR-POWERED DIRECT STEAM GENERATION BOILER FOR AN EDUCATIONAL DESKTOP RANKINE CYCLE,"This paper presents the design and hardware validation of a unique solar powered boiler for powering a desktop scale steam Rankine power cycle. The primary purpose of the desktop Rankine cycle is to improve engineering education through a hands-on laboratory learning approach. Within this context, we have designed and validated a novel, glass-enclosed boiling chamber that generates steam entirely from the sun. Using a solar concentrator, the sun's heat is focused onto an absorber plate that acts as a heating element. The absorber plate receives solar power via radiation and heats the working fluid through convection. Since this is a direct steam generation boiler, the entering fluid is water that stratifies upon boiling into two steady-state flow regions with both liquid and gaseous phases. A thermal model is developed to characterize the concentrated solar power (CSP), chamber geometry, and heat transfer to the working fluid. A complete solar-to-steam efficiency analysis is presented and validated with the hardware. The boiler's estimated efficiency is 27.7% for converting typical daily solar irradiance to steam. The solar water boiling process can clearly be observed and is an excellent educational tool for both concentrated solar power as well as Rankine cycle power systems.","Toro, X; Compere, M; Van Wie, B; Dikici, B",,WOS

STEAM for Space Leaders of Tomorrow: Human-Systems Integration as a Technique and an Art,"Human-systems integration (HSI) is progressively becoming a central discipline. HSI is grounded on the coconstruction of technology, organizations, and people's activities and jobs. HSI also requires the association of physics, cognitive engineering, and arts. Physics provides necessary knowledge, rules, and constraints that an engineer needs to build a system that works. Cognitive engineering provides knowledge, rules, and constraints that are necessary to safely, efficiently, and comfortably use a system. However, neither physics nor cognitive engineering provides insights or methods that support creativity. Consequently, arts should be integrated into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to make STEAM (with an A for arts). In this article, integration will be presented as creativity and abduction. Visualization supports integration by making abstract constructs more tangible and facilitating effective learning. We will see how during the design of what became NASA Space Exploration Vehicle, we worked with artists and cartoonists, who helped us visualize possible scenarios. They first drew cartoons that were displayed around a room and developed animations. We used them not only as tangible visualizations of our concepts but also as mediating representations that integrated multiple participants' views. This article is also based on the experience of International Space University Space Studies Program 2012 where we carried out a project on what space can contribute to global STEM education, which clearly anticipated the shift from STEM to STEAM. We will advocate that space leaders of tomorrow should physically, cognitively, and creatively investigate a specific planet, that is Earth in addition to the other planets. This development is true for both governmental and commercial space activities. We will conclude on the fact that HSI is both a technique and an art, and qualifies for being a STEAM discipline.","Boy, GA",10.1089/space.2019.0031,WOS

"Make World, A Collaborative Platform to Develop Computational Thinking and STEAM","The demand for computer programming professionals in STEAM-related areas has rocketed in the last decade. Initiatives such as the Hour of Code or CodeWeek take advantage of online platforms like Code.org to reach millions of students through a one-hour introduction to computer science and computer programming. Despite the excellent curricular design of Code.org courses, we believe that learners could benefit from a platform where they can create their own programming challenges that can be shared, assessed and remixed by the rest of the users. We named this platform Make World (http://makeworld.eu). After more than one year of use, we studied how students and teachers used this tool to propose and solve learning activities where computational thinking and STEAM skills are developed at the same time. This paper describes the main characteristics of Make World and analyses the use and piloting phase where more than 500 students of primary education have participated to measure the impact of Make World in their learning. The result of this analysis provides a better understanding of the difficulties students face when using a technological platform for STEAM and computational thinking education.","Guenaga, M; Mentxaka, I; Garaizar, P; Eguiluz, A; Villagrasa, S; Navarro, I",10.1007/978-3-319-58515-4_5,WOS

Finding the Joy in the Unknown: Implementation of STEAM Teaching Practices in Middle School Science and Math Classrooms,"In response to a desire to strengthen the economy, educational settings are emphasizing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum and programs. Yet, because of the narrow approach to STEM, educational leaders continue to call for a more balanced approach to teaching and learning, which includes the arts, design, and humanities. This desire created space for science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education, a transdisciplinary approach that focuses on problem-solving. STEAM-based curricula and STEAM-themed schools are appearing all over the globe. This growing national and global attention to STEAM provides an opportunity for teacher education to explore the ways in which teachers implement STEAM practices, examining the successes and challenges, and how teachers are beginning to make sense of this innovative teaching practice. The purpose of this paper is to examine the implementation of STEAM teaching practices in science and math middle school classrooms, in hopes to provide research-based evidence on this emerging topic to guide teacher educators.","Quigley, CF; Herro, D",10.1007/s10956-016-9602-z,WOS
Sustainable practices: Solar hydrogen fuel and education program on sustainable energy systems,"Owing to the increasingly apparent climate change, it becomes imperative to use renewable energy in the production of fuel that is environmentally friendly. At the same time, there is a need to introduce the related education programs to develop the skills of the technical staff working at the front line of rapidly developing renewable energy technologies. Hydrogen is expected to be the fuel in the near future. At present hydrogen fuel is mainly produced using steam reforming of methane (SRM). However, hydrogen generation using the SRM results in emission of greenhouse gases and climate change. Therefore, there is a common consensus that the SRM technology will soon be challenged by the technologies of solar hydrogen generation using photoelectrochemical cells (PEG). However, the PEG technology will be the ultimate winner only if the effects related to climate change and pollution are fully monetised. While such radical development is difficult for implementation due to economic reasons, the increasingly urgent need to reduce climate change dictates the need to increase competitiveness of the PEG method. This imposes the need to increase the efficiency of the solar energy conversion and reduce the costs of the related raw materials and devices. The development of renewable energy-related technologies, such as those related to solar hydrogen, imposes the need to introduce education programs in order to train technical and research staff working at the front line of rapidly developing sustainable energy systems. The present work considers such programs addressing a range of energy-related topics, such as hydrogen energy, electrochemical energy, photoelectrochemical energy and alternative renewable energy as well as industrial ecology and energy policy. It is concluded that implementation of these programs is urgently needed in order to protect the environment through sustainable development. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Normalizing Black Students/Youth and their Families' Digital and STEAM Literacies,"Due to the paucity of research that focuses on the digital and STEAM literacy practices of Black students and youth and their families in home and community spaces, this article acts as a call for awareness to understand the already-existing digital practices that acknowledges and honors their racial, cultural, and social lives. Lewis Ellison addresses four primary questions that K-12 teachers must be aware of concerning Black parents, students and youth in digital and STEM spaces: Why are Black Students'/ Youth and Families' Digital Literacy Practices important? What can we learn from Black Parents' Narratives about their Children's Digital and STEAM Literacies? What do Black Students/Youth Wish their Teachers Knew about Them? What Should Digital and STEM Literacy Practices Look Like for Black Students/Youth? These questions are important when thinking about Black students' and youth's digital literacy learning and proficiencies because as the education and political world keeps changing, they need digital literacy skills for every area of their lives. Once we understand the roles we play in centering their lives and practices, then we can advance teacher education, and then we can begin a discussion to normalize Black students and their families' digital and STEAM literacies and practices.","Ellison, TL",10.1002/trtr.2182,WOS
"Deterritorialising the Research Space: Artistic Research, Embodied Knowledge, and the Academy","Artistic research has in recent years concerned itself with the nature of practice and how this may be framed as research. These debates may have blinded us to a more fundamental concern: territorial claims to the research space made by other forces. Competition for access to material and human resources, funds, space, and infrastructural support, among others, drive debates about the academic status of performance within higher education. The main objective of this article is to demonstrate how the ideological imbalances underpinning the concepts of artistic knowledge and research in Higher Education have contributed to this territorialization. In a milieu of overmanagement, these imbalances often go unquestioned largely because of the university's ever-decreasing role in interrogating the agenda set by others who stand to benefit from it.","Duby, M; Barker, PA",10.1177/2158244017737130,WOS
A study on the learning experience of visitors of digital museums in STEAM education: From the perspective of visitors' visual evaluation,"Public education in museums has the interdisciplinary nature of STEAM education contemporary learning. In the contemporary learning process of the public, digital museums can rely on mobile terminals to provide people with opportunities for mobile learning. Especially since the global outbreak of COVID-19, many offline museums have been forced to close their doors or impose restrictions. How to use digital museums to better carry out the learning experience of visitors is a problem worthy of attention. Effective dissemination of visual information can help digital museums conduct educational activities more efficiently. The purpose of this study was to explore a research method for visual evaluation of visitors' learning experiences in digital museums. The visual evaluation of visitors in the digital museum learning experience involves the layout of exhibition content, the form of exhibition space, and the way of display of exhibits. Through eye-tracking engineering experiments, we obtain and analyze the visual data of visitors during the educational experience of the digital museum to form an accurate evaluation. This method can be used to assess the visual satisfaction of visitors with the educational experience of a digital museum in mobile learning. This kind of evaluation research can provide strong data support and design optimization direction guidance for the development of digital museum public education.","Zhang, X; Hu, JM",10.3389/fpsyg.2022.994693,WOS
Zen and the Art of STEAM: Student Knowledge and Experiences in Interdisciplinary and Traditional Engineering Capstone Experiences,"This Research Full Paper examines the concept of flow, derived from Zen philosophy and positive psychology, and how interdisciplinary STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) and disciplinary electrical engineering students find flow within their coursework and their capstone design experiences. STEAM education incorporates the arts and humanities into the traditional disciplines of STEM. However, students involved in this interdisciplinary space often struggle to find a balance in applying both creative and logical knowledge in their work. The theoretical framework for this study leverages the concept of pure experience from Zen philosophy to analyze flow states in students' interdisciplinary experiences. This theory focuses on the unity of subject/object and rejection of purely logical, positivist thinking for more integrative knowledge acquisition while in flow states. In this secondary analysis, we analyzed interviews conducted with electrical engineering and STEAM students. STEAM students from an interdisciplinary program were found to approach their coursework differently than engineering students, likely because of a difference in assignment guidelines. The engineering students in the study had more restrictive guidelines, while the STEAM students were given more freedom to move between disciplines. Alternatively, students from both disciplines shared many similar values about education and knowledge including the need for enjoyment and personal interest within the coursework as well as finding a balance between logical thought and the desire for creation that a student's program did not determine whether they reached a state of pure experience, or flow, in their work. However, rigid adherence to either the arts or engineering seemed to create disharmony and very few students find cohesion between their values and their approach to knowledge. This paper points to new insights into the design of capstone experiences for STEAM education.","Bates, R; Lord, SM; Tilley, E",10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637284,WOS
Teaching the concept of time: A steam-based program on computational thinking in science education,"The aim of this research was to develop a STEAM-based program for teaching middle school students the concept of time to enhance their computational thinking skills. The proposed Time Teaching Program (TTP) consists of modules and activities on the definition of time, historical development of time measurement tools, universal time measurement system, space-time theory, and time as a fourth dimension. To determine the effectiveness of TTP and its effect on middle school students' computational thinking skills, a mixed methodology was adopted in which both a quasi-experimental design including a pretest-posttest control group and an observational case study were used concurrently. The study group consisted of eighth-grade students from a public middle school in Turkey, selected according to the convenient sampling method. A computational thinking test was used to collect quantitative data, and observations and semi-structured interviews were utilized for the collection of qualitative data. According to the results of analyses, when the effects of the pretest scores were not considered, there was a significant difference (F.(469), 1, R-2=.518) between the final test scores of the experimental and control groups in favor of the former. Based on these findings, it can be stated that the proposed STEAM-based program significantly improves the computational thinking skills of eighth-grade middle school students.","Bati, K; Yetisir, MI; Çaliskan, I; Günes, G; Gül Saçan, E",10.1080/2331186X.2018.1507306,WOS
From STEM to STEAM: Cracking the Code? How Creativity & Motivation Interacts with Inquiry-based Learning,"STEM subjects enriched with Arts (STEAM) are assumed to enhance science lessons and making them more attractive. A multidisciplinary STEAM module integrating inquiry-based learning was implemented to a sample of 160 students (11-12 years; 43.1% females). In a four-hour lesson, dealing with scientific phenomena surrounding bird flight, students learned at self-explanatory workstations that allowed space for creativity and a high level of autonomy. An arts facet was employed, using collaborative handicraft artwork. A workbook offered guidance, while the teacher's role was of a passive tutor. A pre-/post-/retention-test design monitored knowledge, motivation, and two factors associated with creativity (Act and Flow) two weeks before, immediately after and six weeks later. The intervention produced long-term knowledge and built stable scores of intrinsic motivation, but self-reported aspects of creativity were not affected with a single STEAM intervention. Thus, it seems obvious that regular training in an adequate sociocultural setting is needed to develop creativity sustainably. Nevertheless, this study monitored the correlation of knowledge motivation and creativity in a science education setting for the first time. The findings indicate that fostering creativity, for example in STEAM environments, is a promising starting point for research into promoting motivation and creativity in educational settings.","Conradty, C; Bogner, FX",10.1080/10400419.2019.1641678,WOS

"EXPLORIA, STEAM Education at University Level as a New Way to Teach Engineering Mechanics in an Integrated Learning Process","The objective of our research is the implementation of STEAM (Science Technology Engineering Art Mathematics) learning in the bachelor of Engineering in industrial design and product development at CEU Cardenal Herrera University through the EXPLORIA project. This article implements and develops the proposal for the first year of this bachelor, which includes 24 students aged 18-20. This article focuses on how to integrate STEAM learning within the EXPLORIA project for the improvement in the learning of the physics subject, and in particular, regarding the part of the syllabus related to mechanical engineering through different projects, challenges and milestones that allow the student to see the use in the design and development of products. The EXPLORIA project connects the competencies of the different STEAM subjects included in the bachelor, designing a learning process as a logical, sequential and incremental itinerary. Through concepts on which the fundamentals of design are based: shape, volume, color, space and structure. In particular, this article shows the adaptation made in the physical part to be able to teach the integrated mechanics part in this learning process. The complete learning was carried out through several challenges and two milestones the students had to overcome through the application of the physical knowledge learned in class. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, at the end of the paper, an ad hoc questionnaire is carried out showing the students' assessment regarding the new teaching methodology.","Montés, N; Aloy, P; Ferrer, T; Romero, PD; Barquero, S; Carbonell, AM",10.3390/app12105105,WOS
Relational epistemologies in land-based learning environments: reasoning about ecological systems and spatial indexing in motion,"Social and cultural practices in learning settings are sites for leveraging and/or remediating sustainable and just conceptions of nature-culture relations to meet changing environmental demands of twenty-first century. In this study,we examine epistemic navigation among Indigenous youth in an outdoor, land based, STEAM (science, education, arts, math, and science) camp which not only leveraged nature-culture relations as part of critical engagement with socio-ecological systems, but also as a site for Indigenous resurgence and well-being in learning spaces. Wetake a microethnographic (Gee and Green in Rev Res Educ 23:119-169, 1998. 10.2307/1167289) approachto examine sense-making among three youth while engaged in a walking activity in which they were asked to embody a plant as part of cultural practices of reading the land. We found that the micro-practice of spatial indexing dynamically mediated sense-making about ecological systems as participants coordinated attention and observations between humans and more-than-human kinds. This form of sense making reflected both cultural and historical experiences, which students leveraged in their understandings of complex socio-ecological systems.","Pugh, P; McGinty, M; Bang, M",10.1007/s11422-019-09922-1,WOS
Music notes to amino acid sequence: A STEAM approach to study protein structure,"Recently, manuscripts that use bioinformatics tools to convert proteins and other biological materials into music have appeared in several journals. The authors claim that this type of studies adds joy to education of life sciences and attract public attention to biochemistry education along with other uses. We thought the reverse of the process might also be possible for the purpose. We converted notes into amino acids depending on the decreasing hydrophobicity and by using the famous nursery song Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star notes, a hypothetical protein sequence was obtained. Three-dimensional structures were modeled by I-Tasser Protein Structure and Function Prediction server and the structure of the possible models were investigated. This Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) approach may bring fun to protein structure education.

"Maker Education: Assessment, Documentation, and Sharing With a Wider Community","Makerspaces and the learning and teaching associated with them have become a growing area of interest in K-12 education, especially with respect to student engagement in STEM. While the benefits of maker education in schools have been studied, little empirical research has been on how to assess K-12 student learning through making. In this paper, the authors address this gap by examining the research question: How do educators assess the learning experience in maker education? The authors took a sample of four different non-profit and in-school STEAM programs in Ontario, Canada and carried out a qualitative case study. They conducted interviews, observations, and document analysis. The findings revealed that authentic assessment practices were used at each research site. Further, sharing the learning experience with the wider community beyond the classroom benefited the students and teachers in the programs as well as students and educators both local and outside the programs. This study sheds light on the nature and benefits of assessment and documentation in makerspaces.","Bertrand, MG; Namukasa, IK",10.4018/IJOPCD.304083,WOS

The main conclusions of analyzing relevant factors are as follows: 1. The higher star one course gets, the more popular the course is. And word of mouth and teaching experience play important part in course selecting. 2. Some districts like Mentougou and Tongzhou are lack of course resources, resulting in the popularity of these courses are higher than other areas with rich curriculum resources. 3. The courses offered by museums are more popular than those offered by scientific research institutions, which may have something to do with the packaging of the course. 4. The most popular course is about Astronomy, closely followed by Electronics, Information Technology and Physics. And students have less interest in courses related to Geography and Data and Information. 5. The curriculum of Information Technology is a kind of new course comparing to other curricula, which is regarded as STEAM course in a narrow sense. This kind of course is popular which indicates that students accept new type of curriculum well.","Wei, YG; Shi, LN; Sun, B; Zhu, XM",,WOS
CULTURAL SIGNS - BEYOND CONCEPTS AND BOUNDARIES,"This article is mostly about my own artwork and partly about my approach to art education in college. My artwork covers an artistic production process of about 40 years, extending from environmental art to historical and cultural environment. The artistic analysis that originated my work started in 1978 and continued throughout 1980s with The Visual Evaluations related to the Pollution in Izmir Gulf. These were a series of paintings intervening the physical environmental problems. Supported by scientific evidence from research labs, my analysis consisted of both artistic and non-artistic elements. Later came Efes-Oren Visual Notes series and then came the study series covering various cultural regions of Anatolia; Anatolian Civilizations - Intercultural, Anatolian Civilizations - Cultural Environment, Anatolian Civilizations - Cultural Logos, Anatolian Civilizations - Cultural Aspects. Currently, my work continues with the series, Cultural Implications - Tracing the Image. Anatolia, the geography I live in, has been home to many cultures like the Greek, Hittite, Lycian and Phrygian throughout history. Anatolian Civilizations with their cultural wealth, different cultures and cultural layers constitute the concept and idea of my work The language of art is universal. However, lifestyles, cultures and ways of seeing are different. In other words, arts have channels and roots that feed on their own culture and geography. Despite being on the axis of painting, my work is not limited to canvas and colour aesthetics. It includes a dimension extending from the surface to the space. My art is the notes of my thoughts. Different materials and research materials are available depending on the concept. On an educational level, this article aims to emphasize the importance of art in the Third Culture Period, which suggests the coexistence of science and art that seems to be the educational model of the future. This model is made up of science, technology and engineering branches together with art. Emphasis is laid on STEAM - Science / Technology / Engineering / Art and Mathematics - training model. Also, future educational tendencies in some universities and research institutions such as the inclusion of artists in NASA's space exploration programmes and bio-constructive experiments and research on Symbotica A programme in Western University in Australia are further dealt with.","Akdeniz, H",,WOS
Sharing Power: Leadership Lessons from Interdisciplinary Practices in an Art Museum,"Fine arts museums are undergoing a radical transformation, from closed containers of things to porous spaces onsite and online where the visitor experience is paramount. The current moment is accelerating this transformative evolution of museums into institutions that feel relevant and attractive to diverse audiences, now increasingly on multiple platforms. This change on the visitor-facing side needs to mirror a change in practices and attitudes on the inside. As part of this transformative effort a few art museums are supporting a new generation of leaders that have traditionally been in the shadows-those in charge of conservation and scientific research. The infusion of conservation and science narratives in art museums can change visitors' mode of engagement, diversify content entry points to art for those drawn to science, inspire new public offerings, transform museum spaces to make the practice of conservation and scientific research visible, and attract new funding streams. In this paper we share recent experiences at the Art Institute of Chicago, distilling some key elements that can help transform museums into more equitable and multidisciplinary spaces of inquiry. The work underway builds on the values of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering Art and Math) education and takes place in the context of a growing field of collaborative and interdisciplinary museum practice.","Casadio, F",10.1111/cura.12421,WOS
Insights from bauhaus innovation for education and workplaces in a post-pandemic world,"This paper examines Bauhaus School (1919-1933) innovation and relevance today. The School is a landmark in the history of design as a discipline and the development of design education. The School was also a workplace, commercialising Bauhaus-designed products. While drawing global interest in its innovations, the School faced resistance in Germany because it challenged conventions. This problem raises the questions: How did the School-workplace generate innovations amid the calamity of post-war Germany, and what is the significance of the Bauhaus for post-pandemic education and workplaces one hundred years on? The concept of 'transgression' is used to understand innovation at the Bauhaus School-workplace. Haraway discusses transgressive practices that disrupt established knowledges, moving ways of thinking and doing in new directions. Analysis of workplace learning research reveals that three interfacing dimensions make up innovation: (1) workplace environments, (2) the culture-order that facilitates innovation, and (3) learning in practice in authentic settings. This qualitative case study reports on how Bauhaus innovation emerged at the intersection of these key dimensions. There are surprising commonalities between the Bauhaus approach to innovation in challenging times and contemporary thinking about supporting innovation which are relevant to education, particularly STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) education, and workplaces in a world affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. Thus, encouraging people who challenge boundaries, rules or 'the way things are' can support innovation. This paper addresses a gap in workplace learning research on interrelated dimensions of innovation which the Bauhaus recognized. The study also offers an innovative approach to the examination of innovation across time and space whereas most contemporary studies of innovation focus on the present. Further, conceptualizing innovation as transgression offers a new way of thinking about innovation in design and in the workplace.","White-Hancock, L",10.1007/s10798-022-09729-2,WOS
The possibility of convergent education in Classical Literature and Science: Evidence from Korea,"This paper presented a study on the possibility of convergent education of Korean classical poetry, songs and science. The significance of this paper is as follows. Firstly, that the convergent education of literature and science was started from the ancient times; hence, the origin of it is very long. Secondly, we can think about the ancient methods of passing down scientific knowledge through the convergent education of classical literature and science. In the modern era's point of view, mythology is literature, but in the ancient times' viewpoint, mythology is a part of science history. Thirdly, we learned about the creative idea of understanding the close relationship between astronomical and humanities-related phenomena through classical poetry and songs. Fourthly, it is found that a lot of scientific knowledge exists in literature, contributing to a deeper understanding of literature. Fifthly, we learned that if existing literature classes changed into convergent classes with sciences, then even the same literary pieces would be understood in a whole new way. Furthermore, through literature, we discover the importance of developing an upright character, and how closely related this is to societal problems. The real meaning of convergent education of literature and science-based on classics is here elucidated.","Chung, SY",,WOS
Re-Making Teacher Professional Development,"With the introduction of the new two-year Bachelor of Education program across Ontario, our Faculty of Education has introduced a twenty-hour internship. This internship is meant to provide real-world teaching experience for teacher candidates, who are nearing the end of their formal education. By maker pedagogies, we refer to the inquiry-based, student-directed, constructionist approaches to learning typically used in makerspaces. Makerspaces have gained traction in Ontario classrooms, particularly in the last two years. These spaces and their pedagogies facilitate the development of students' global competencies (Hughes, 2017; Somanath et al., 2016). We welcomed eleven teacher candidates (TCs) into our STEAM 3D Maker Lab as part of their internship course for professional development (PD) to provide them with pedagogical experience in a makerspace environment. Our research focused on exploring how the TCs developed a better understanding of maker pedagogies and the associated tools through this PD. As the internship was created and facilitated by an education graduate student in the lab, we extended the research to also investigate this student's development in identifying and understanding some of the best practices associated with making as learning. Through analysis of the TCs' and graduate student's experiences, we identify some best practices in maker-focused professional development for beginning teachers.","Hughes, J; Morrison, L; Dobos, L",10.3233/978-1-61499-923-2-602,WOS
THE USAGE OF GO-LAB PLATFORM TOOLS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF STUDENTS' RESEARCH SKILLS,"The article introduces the Inquiry Based Learning approach for innovative contemporary teaching STEAM subjects in primary and secondary school sectors. The Go-Lab ecosystem features are presented (https://www.golabz.eu). The Go-Lab repository offers the large set of educational apps, extensive collection of remote and virtual laboratories as well as more than thousands of Inquiry Learning Spaces (ILS) for blended and distance learning. The platform, which successfully is used in many school institutions throughout the globe, has become available in Ukraine due to the EU Programme ERASMUS + K2 Modernization of Pedagogical Higher Education by Innovative Teaching Instruments - MoPED (No. 586098-EPP-1-2017-1-UA-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP). The ILS as a personalized research environment for self-study of STEAM subjects is introduced. Using Go-Lab apps students can ask questions, formulate hypothesis, experiment, make a conclusion and discussion the getting results, therefore, developing critical thinking, research and scientific skills, and digital competence. In addition, the benefits of usage of virtual and remote labs in the classroom is demonstrated. The authors introduce open, guided, and structured types of Inquiry Based Learning applying integrated Go-Lab inquiry cycle, which consists of orientation, conceptualization, research, conclusions and discussion phases. This platform allows teachers create the own virtual Inquiry Learning Space, modify or use as it is existing ones, shared by other Go-Lab ecosystem users/teachers. The ILSs in Ukrainian presented in the article may work as an example of innovative learning materials to national educators who would like to empower their students with 21st century skills and competences as well as active online experimentations, solving real-life scientific problem and challenges, and independently learning practices. The assessment criteria for evaluating the students ILSs developed during the teaching IBL methodology at the Vasyl Stefanyk Precarpathian National University are outlined. At the same time, the necessity of development of new online laboratories fit to school education state standards and Ukrainian curriculum taking into account the contemporary pedagogical approaches and theories, such as inquiry based learning, motivational theories, cognitive load theory, experiential learning (reflection in or on action) is emphasized. The novelty of the scientific research is to substantiate the theoretical and methodological approaches of using Inquiry Based Learning of the Go-Lab ecosystem in the New Ukrainian School.","Budnyk, O; Dziabenko, O",10.33407/itlt.v80i6.3953,WOS
Teaching Optics Concepts through an Approach that Emphasizes the Colors of Nature,"A wide variety of optics concepts can be taught using the overall perspective of colors of nature as a guiding and unifying theme. This approach is attractive and interesting with a wide appeal to children, nature enthusiasts, photographers, and artists. This approach also encourages a deep understanding of the natural world and the role of coloration in biology, remote sensing, the aurora, mineralogy, meteorology, in human-made objects, and astronomy, to name a few. Third, using this theme promotes a close look at optical phenomena at all size scales-from the microscopic (e.g. silica spheres in opals) to the mid-scale (the aurora), to the largest scale (astronomical phenomena such as gaseous emission nebula). Fourth, the natural and human-constructed world provides accessible and beautiful examples of complex phenomena such as interference, diffraction, atomic and molecular emissions, Rayleigh and Mie scattering, illumination engineering, and fluorescence. These areas can be explored successfully in the context of colors of nature. Finally, using the colors of nature also promotes an understanding of technology, from flashlights to streetlights, from telescopes and binoculars, to spectrometers and digital cameras. For examples something as simple as how to set the white balance on a digital camera to get a realistic looking photograph can lead to a lengthy exploration of spectrally selective surfaces and their reflectance, the nature of different illumination sources, the meaning of color temperature, and role of calibration in a digital image. We have used this approach of teaching using the colors of nature as an organizing theme in our NSF-funded project Project STEAM: Integrating Art with Science to Build Science Identities Among Girls (colorsofnature.org).","Pompea, SM; Carsten-Conner, LD",10.1117/12.2223238,WOS
BIM AND 3D IMPRESSION,"This research is the result of work carried out by the PIE-DIBARQ Group of Educational Innovation ETSEM-UPM during the 2016-2017 courses in its effort to implement a methodology adapted to the new requirements of European Convergence in Higher Education through the use of new technologies and the introduction to them for the students. Nowadays we are not only teaching conventional techniques, but they're trying, at least experimentally, to show each student more innovative ways in Architectural Representation. This is the case of the use of computers, and the new language BIM. We are not only referring to the computer-assisted instruction, where the teacher is developing several experimental units as fixing the theoretical concepts taught, but also to the use and knowledge of the computer as an element used by the professional as a graphic expression of their ideas, or studies. Although the concept of 3D printer has its origin in the 80's it is now taking more and more strength, and it is already starting to be used in many industries. The future of 3D printers is promising and from 2014 we begun to be more familiar with them and for sure we will get better printer with a lower prices. The 3D printer is considered by the European Space Agency (ESA) as a pioneering invention of the Third Industrial Revolution, as the steam engine and the internal combustion engine were once. The ability to print anything we have in our computer modelling before is a real change in our conception of production, being classified by experts as disruptive technology more powerful than the Internet itself. If it was possible to print parts for spaceships, food and even human organs, the range of possibilities expands the conception of a giant 3D printer in 24 hours can build a house of more than 200 square meters. Although this is the future of printing the truth it is that when one starts to learn seriously about a 3D printer, discovers with some frustration that the information accessible is rather fanciful. Much is written about the potential of these machines, and we found images of beautiful sculptures of impossible shapes, jewellery or accessories that seem to be taken from a workshop of professional jewellery. In this paper we will see the problems and resolution of the 3D printing in Architecture.","López, MV; Contreras, MCS; Sanz, SM; Díaz, JRO",,WOS
On-Screen Puppets: a methodological strategy for creative expression and interdisciplinary learning,"This paper reports on the research Puppets, Humans and Machines, an Interdisciplinary Circuit for learning, cultural exchange, and creative expression(2). The main purpose of the research was the development of a Hybrid Technological Puppet Theatre (TTH). It allowed 4 and 9 years children to create puppets, stages and characters. A Research-Creation methodology was used, through a procedural route divided into three phases: Exploration Laboratory, Creation Laboratory, and Implementation Laboratory. In a cross-sectional way, working groups were developed. In these spaces, a group of researchers developed the Puppets on Screen Methodological Strategy; it started from the premises proposed by the STEAM pedagogical model. This strategy includes the following components: TTH, didactic sequence; website and design of an expository version of the TTH. The process developed at all phases allowed to examine the potential of the Puppets on Screen strategy as a space for digital interaction that provides a holistic learning connected with the realities of children, in an environment beyond the guidelines of specific disciplinary concepts. In turn, the strategy allows the child to act as a subject with capacities to produce, individually and collectively, creative thought, given that he (she) can stage his reflections in a sensitive language. The above provides spaces for interdisciplinary teaching in which, children address various problems from the complexity of the elements that define them, a holistic approach to understanding and solving contemporary and current problems.","Acevedo, ICR; Jaramillo, AMM; García, AMT",10.17533/udea.unipluri.20.2.06,WOS
Mission to Psyche: Including Undergraduates and the Public on the Journey to a Metal World,"The NASA Psyche mission's program to engage university undergraduates and the public in the mission is inspired by and built upon the extensive foundation of public engagement, educational outreach activities, and expertise of NASA and mission partner institutions. The program leverages the enthusiasm and contributions of undergraduates nationwide to the benefit of the mission, the students and their institutions and communities, and the broader public. Psyche Student Collaborations consists of four main programs, two (Psyche Capstone and Psyche Inspired) are available solely to undergraduates enrolled at universities or community colleges in the United States and its territories and two (Innovation Toolkit free online courses and Science Outreach Interns and Docents) invite broader participation by engaging the talents and creativity of undergraduate interns to help create content and events to reach the public and lifelong learners. Together, these offerings provide multiple entry points and a spectrum of intensity of experiences, numbers of participants, disciplinary diversity, and mode of delivery. Involving undergraduates in all phases of the program supports the development of the next generation of explorers, contributes to the nation's workforce preparation, and complements NASA's existing undergraduate offerings by providing long-term opportunities for students to participate with the mission through established postsecondary education structures like capstone courses.","Bowman, CDD; Elkins-Tanton, LT; Talamante, A; Bell, JF; Cisneros, E; Cook, A; Frieman, JD; Gainor, D; Hunziker, J; Khan, S; Lawler, CR; Maschino, J; McCoy, TJ; Nessi, K; Oran, R; Seal, D; Simon, A; Singh, R; Tolbert, CM; Valentine, K; Weiss, B; Wenkert, DD; Williams, DA",10.1007/s11214-023-00967-x,WOS
Math Learning in a Science Museum-Proposal for a Workshop Design Based on STEAM Strategy to Learn Mathematics. The Case of the Cryptography Workshop,"In mathematics teaching, great efforts are made, and diverse teaching strategies are employed in order to facilitate students' learning process. Informal environments have proven to be conducive and motivating spaces for science learning. In particular, science museums can be used as a complement and collaborate in order to leverage each of their strengths to motivate mathematics learning. Educational models give a global explanation to the learning process. Taking into account all these aspects and considering van Hiele's model as didactic reference, we propose the design of a general workshop that has among its objectives the learning of mathematics. To do this, we start from the three main elements and processes set forth in van Hiele's model: insight, reasoning levels and learning phases. The insight or student's competence are formulated through Hoffer's abilities, and for the development of the activities of the learning phases, the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and maths) strategy. Once the general proposal has been made, we use it to design a scientific workshop for learning mathematics about cryptography. Our greatest challenge was in generating activities adapted to the established requirements. It would be interesting, for future works, to design research to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposal presented. Moreover, it would be interesting to develop a proposal for assessing student learning.","Roldán-Zafra, J; Perea, C",10.3390/math10224335,WOS
The Impact of a Mobile 3D Printing and Making Platform on Student Awareness and Engagement,"3D printing technology has played an integral part in the growth of makerspaces, showing potential in enabling the integration of art (A) with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines, giving new possibilities to STEAM implementation. This paper presents the effectiveness of a deployable mobile making platform and its curriculum, focused on 3D printing education. This setup, which draws inspiration from modern makerspaces, was deployed for 227 undergraduate students in Art and Engineering majors at multiple campuses of a large northeastern university and used in either a pre-arranged hour-long session or voluntary walk-in session. Self-reported surveys were created to measure participants' pre- and post-exposure awareness of 3D printing, design, and STEAM quantified through their (1) familiarity, (2) attitude, (3) interest, and (4) self-efficacy. Additionally, observations on participant engagement and use of the space were made. Statistically significant increases in awareness of 3D printing technology were observed in the participants from both Art and Engineering majors, as well as at different campus locations, irrespective of their initial differences. Observations also show a difference in engagement between prearranged sessions and walk-in sessions, which indicates that different session formats may promote specific engagement with different participant types. Ultimately, this research demonstrates two key findings: (1) though they may gravitate to different elements of 3D printing and design, a single makerspace can be used to engage both Art and Engineering students and (2) by introducing mobility to the traditional idea of a makerspace, participants with different initial levels of AM awareness can be brought to similar final awareness. This second finding is especially essential given the disparities in modern student access to 3D printing technology.","Sinha, S; Rieger, K; Knochel, AD; Meisel, NA",,WOS
Exploring Making in Schools: A Maker-Framework for Teachers in K12,"In recent years, the Maker movement has surged in popularity and has become attractive for didactic research. Exploration, creativity, open learning spaces, and problem-orientation are the foundations for successful Maker-Education. While the relevance of Making in higher education is slowly being recognized, it is still uncharted territory for most schools. As part of the Making at School project, the Zurich University of Teacher Education, together with the University of Zurich and the CreativeLab Zurich, is committed to creating interdisciplinary modules for Making, e.g., in biology, computer science, or handicraft. The main goal is to help teachers to develop a Maker mindset by providing ideas for designing their own projects. This paper presents a preliminary planning framework that is evaluated by (inter-)national experts in Making. This first assessment shows that the framework is described as useful and appealing, but still too complex to be used in schools.","Spieler, B; Schifferle, TM; Dahinden, M",10.1145/3535227.3535234,WOS
GREEN STEM: VIRTUAL REALITY RENEWABLE ENERGY LABORATORY FOR REMOTE LEARNING,"In fulfilling its role as a promotor of critical thinking and of nurturer of students as problem solvers, undergraduate engineering education needs to answer modern educational demands tailoring curricula to meet industry and career requirements and student learning styles. Extended Reality technology, including virtual and mixed reality may enable educators to create tools for multisensory teaching, enhancing learning through guided imagery and haptics. Through undergraduate research, two co-op students explored the VR technology (engine) and developed the framework for a learning module that will present fundamental notions in renewable energy sources, using scenarios based on physical experiments. We developed a virtual reality learning platform and the modeling of the VR framework and applied it to several experimental modules: wind turbine, solar cell (PV) module, a water decomposition and fuel cell module. Students explore concepts as parametric characterizations of the system as well as thermochemical characterization. The module is packed in an executable app, which is downloadable and usable in both VR STEAM immersive environments as well as in a desktop format. Future work will include beta-testing and preliminary assessment of the VR Renewable Lab, followed by its course implementation.","Frank, K; Gardner, AE; Husanu, INC; Chiou, RY; Ruane, R",,WOS
Thermal-hydraulic investigations to the flow of model gases at a PWR fuel assembly dummy and overflow of air above the top of the dummy,"The burnt fuel assemblies, which are unloaded from the reactor core, are storage in a water-cooled storage pool until radioactivity and heat decays to the authorized transportation value of dry storage containers. With the incident in a storage pool fatal consequences can occur that depend on the initiating event (station blackout, loss of coolant, etc.). The integrity of the cladding tubes of the fuel assemblies is an important aspect in the nuclear safety. Thermal-hydraulic phenomena were investigated, which occur during evaporation of the storage pool and overheating of the steam followed by an upwards flow in the fuel assembly boxes. According the principle of similarity, physical parameters of the steam upwards flow were simulated by not heated model gases. The overflow of air above the fuel assembly storage boxes was experimentally investigated in a horizontal overflow channel. The conditions of the air overflow were vary by air conditioning (temperature, humidity). The interactions of density driven flow or diffusion (air / gas model) and the interaction (air / steam) with the overflow simulated the thermal hydraulic phenomena during these processes. The paper includes the presentation of the experimental facility and some results of the experiments. This research project supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research named SINABEL (Safety of spent fuel pools: Experimental analysis, modeling and validation of system and CFD codes) delivers with a combination of experiments and simulations, knowledge's of the heat transfer processes for the case of a partially or completely evaporated spent fuel storage pool in light water reactor nuclear power plants both within the fuel rod bundle of a fuel assembly (FA) and in the spaces between the FA in order to be able to predict via the modeling and simulation the development of the axial and radial temperature profiles of rods by different accident scenarios.

Implementation of a Playful Microproject Based on Traditional Games for Working on Mathematical and Scientific Content,"According to previous research, we consider it necessary to extend the use of games, as mediating elements, in the learning of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) contents rejected by many students. For this, we have carried out an educational research project on games, with an ethnomathematical approach, since games are an important cultural sign with mathematical and scientific potentialities. We have prepared an anthropological study and an analytical one, generating a catalogue of games from different cultures. Thus, we have verified that, starting with culture, we can get to the game, but we posed the query as to whether, starting from certain games, we could achieve enculturation, by activating mathematical and scientific content in the players. To answer this query, we have created a curricular design called playful microproject  with three traditional games from different cultures and geographical contexts. The microproject was implemented with 32 participants, from 8 to 12 years old. To analyse the results of the microproject, a case study was carried out using qualitative methodology. As part of the playful microproject, the necessary materials for each game were made by hand, and the games were then played. Both the realization of the games and the act of playing showed evidence of mathematical and scientific content, although more in the act of playing. The results revealed that: (1) the three games mobilized 21 categories of analysis, made up of scientific-mathematical content; (2) the three games proved to be equivalent in strong didactic potential; (3) that the microproject provides a valuable intercultural educational approach. The contents evidenced constitute a fundamental part of the Primary Education curriculum: classify, organize, measure, and quantify items, as well as formulate hypotheses, draw conclusions, place oneself in space, and design strategies, among others. It is concluded that these games can promote scientific-mathematical enculturation in a contextualized way.","Fernandez-Oliveras, A; Espigares-Gamez, MJ; Oliveras, ML",10.3390/educsci11100624,WOS
Fundamental Themes in Physics from the History of Art,"Mindful of a stated Project 2061 goal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, emphasizing that scientific literacy includes seeing the scientific endeavor in the light of cultural and intellectual history, and in the continuing spirit of narrowing the gap between the two cultures by enhancing STEAM awareness and education, this essay illustrates, quite literally through well-known works of Western art, the striking parallels between fundamental themes in physics and the visual arts through history. These connections include: the identification of microcosm-macrocosm analogies in prehistoric proto-science; the beginning of the appreciation in pre-classical antiquity of the lawfulness of nature under the aegis of a Divine Lawgiver; the rise of rationalism and the first theories of the architecture of matter during the so-called Greek miracle; the overlapping role of theology's handmaiden during the emblematic medieval Age of Faith; Renaissance renovations and the triumph of the mechanical universe as the capstone of the scientific revolution in the early modern period; the influence on physics of the Romantic notion of an underlying unity in all of nature, and the increasing abstraction in both art and physics during the nineteenth century; and, finally, the parallels between twentieth-century art and the physics of relativity and quantum theory, concluding with examples from modern cosmology.","Fleck, R",10.1007/s00016-020-00269-7,WOS
The 20 year evolution of an energy conversion course at the United States Military Academy,"Over the past several years, an energy conversion course offered by the Mechanical Engineering Program at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, has evolved into a cohesive series of lessons addressing three general topical areas: advanced thermodynamics, advanced mechanical system analysis, and direct energy conversion systems. Mechanical engineering majors enroll in Energy Conversion Systems (ME 472) during the fall semester of their senior year as an advanced elective. ME 472 builds directly on the material covered in Thermodynamics (EM 30 1) taken during the student's junior year. In the first segment of ME 472, the students study advanced thermodynamic topics including exergy and combustion analyses. The students then analyze various mechanical systems including refrigeration systems, internal combustion engines, boilers, and fossil fuel fired steam and gas turbine combined power plants. Exergetic efficiencies of various equipment and systems are determined. The final portion of the course covers direct energy conversion technology, including fuel cells, photovoltaics, thermoelectricity, thermionics and magnetohydrodynamics. Supplemental lessons on energy storage, semi-conductors and non-reactive energy sources (such as solar collectors, wind turbines, and hydroelectric plants) are included here. This paper discusses the evolution of ME 472 since its inception and, explains the motivations for the course's progress. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Critical skills needs and challenges for STEM/STEAM graduates increased employability and entrepreneurship in the solar energy sector,"Energy produced by photovoltaic module (PVM) is poised to deliver the UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7) by 2030 and Net-Zero by 2050 but not until ample graduates with adequate Solar Energy Technology (SET) skills are produced by Higher education institutions (HEIs). Although PVM has witnessed significant penetration globally, the sustainability of the growth of the sector is challenged by attendant monotonic skilled labour shortages. The evolving growth imbalance is critical in the European Union (EU), limits her global competitiveness and necessitates the need to create wider awareness on the green technology to stimulate more production of solar energy sector (SES) specific skills graduates. Discussing the mismatch between the skills Europe needs and has in the SES, the study outlines key critical skills Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) cum Arts (STEAM) graduates ought to possess to secure sector employment and the challenges limiting them from acquiring the competencies. The review is conducted via extensive study of relevant literature, analysis of interviews and observations. Academic, industrial, and entrepreneurial skills are identified as critical SES needs. Designing and running educational modules/curricula that embed the identified solar technology specialist skills on students and learners are proposed as vehicle to increase their employability and entrepreneurship. This study profiles trends and developments in the SES for stakeholders' increased awareness while presenting the specialist skills in-demand for employment in the sector. The adoption of SET Training (SETechTra) curricula/modules by the EIs will substantially increase the production of industry-ready graduates whilst decreasing the SES skills gap.","Amalu, EH; Short, M; Chong, PL; Hughes, DJ; Adebayo, DS; Tchuenbou-Magaia, F; Lähde, P; Kukka, M; Polyzou, O; Oikonomou, TI; Karytsas, C; Gebremedhin, A; Ossian, C; Ekere, NN",10.1016/j.rser.2023.113776,WOS
The culture of disciplines: Reconceptualising multi-subject curricula,"The arts are recognised for their potential to humanise and enrich educational experience, but hold a lowly position in the hierarchy of school subject-based curricula. This limits the time, and thus the influence, they can have. Whilst schools welcome the idea of a curriculum rich with both arts and science subjects, resistance to realising this is often advanced in terms of the proportion of curriculum time required for different subjects. Arguments for STEAM education, whilst apparently challenging this and valuing the potential of the arts, have reinforced its servant role. Drawing on research into a particular project, where the perspectives of the arts and sciences inform and enrich how the other is experienced and understood, we reframe this problem. Firstly, drawing on Massey's conception of space-time, we argue that one can conceive of more than one subject occupying the same curricular space on a school timetable. Secondly, informed by Geertz, we consider what the culture of the arts and the sciences offers, suggesting that this appears to reflect what teachers have valued. We argue that foregrounding the culture of school subjects, and particularly the culture of the arts, as part of a multicultural frame can facilitate rich and engaging educational experiences. Rather than being positioned as competing for time or status in the curriculum, a focus on culture emphasises how the co-existence and interplay of multiple subjects broadens, develops and thus enriches children's educational experience. It also enables a different conception of, and thus role for, the arts in schooling.","Davies, R; Trowsdale, J",10.1002/berj.3735,WOS
Hardware-Software Platform for the Development of STEM Skills,"Robotics not only play a significant role in medicine, manufacturing, or aerospace industry, but also in education. According to governmental studies carried out in the United States and Europe, careers related to STEM skills like engineering, are constantly increasing worldwide. Due to this, several countries have been implementing STEM education. Rut, in Colombia this initiative just recently started to take place. Currently, it is possible to find several STEM educational robotic kits on the market such as boost from Lego, Cozmo from Anki, Mbot from Makeblocks and Dash from Make wonder. In this trend, the STEM robotic kit proposed in this document, pretends to be a hardware grounding to implement a whole STEAM program. It intends to encourage children to develop their science, tech, math, and artistic outcomes. Also, the kit offers a differential plus from others because it has two interactive components: an elephant-bot called Eli, a robot easy to assemble inspired in the protection of African elephants; and, an intuitive user interface, called Experiencia Chamali made up of three modules. The first one consists of assembly the robot, the second one is designed for developing of spatial perception throughout maze challenges, and the last one is made for test the robot's movements live. Two groups of children between 6 and 11 years old tested the robotic platform. During the activity, the groups reinforced STEM skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving as a conclusion of test results. The children divided the assembly of the elephant-hot into several tasks on their initiative to make an agile construction. Also, in the challenge of the labyrinth, they worked collaboratively on the spatial location. Finally, the members of each group worked as a team decorating the physical labyrinth freely and observing the movements of the elephant-hot in this environment.","Feijoo-Almonacid, A; Rodriguez-Garavito, CH",10.1109/RITA.2022.3166969,WOS

These were tested in the laboratory and their greenness was assessed by traditional greenness metrics and metrics inspired in the industrial activity Results showed that the steam distillation technique presents the largest overall greenness when evaluated by the GS, because organic solvents are not involved, but mass and energy metrics indicate that the extractions by solvent techniques are greener This conflict denotes the complexity of the concept of chemical greenness and the need of using several types of metrics when greenness evaluation is at stake The results show that the inclusion of experiments on the R-(+)limonene extraction in the educational laboratory is efficient to show the difficulties of assessing the greenness of chemistry and of implementing Green Chemistry.","Pires, TCM; Ribeiro, MGTC; Machado, AASC",10.21577/0100-4042.20170139,WOS
LEARNING ABOUT STEAM THROUGH THE RESOLUTION OF REAL PROBLEMS AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS,"Many innovative initiatives serve to transform the way our students learn. However, not all the proposed initiatives interest our students because they do not address real problems or because they are disconnected from the reality of their environment. Through the Islands Diversity for Science Education project, students from islands around the world will be able to collaborate and learn relevant content by applying the scientific method and analysing local and global data. It's an innovative, collaborative, experiential, and durable way to learn science. Islands Diversity for Science Education (http://idiverse.eu/) is an educational project, co-funded by the European Erasmus + Agency, which proposes an innovative methodology focusing on scientific knowledge and bringing students to the heart of their community to raise important issues and create relevant and directly applicable solutions with lasting effect. The aim of this project is to offer a methodology for teaching scientific areas based on the exploration of the environment, in the identification of real problems related to biology, geology, astronomy, or physics, for example, so that students can gather information to better understand the problem, advance in knowledge and even propose creative solutions. To achieve this objective the project provide training and educational resources to schools to become open schools, as well as a set of activities based on scientific areas where students develop projects that address the real needs of their community and their environment, following the Design Thinking methodology in an interdisciplinary and Inquiry-based approach. One important pillar of the project and a central objective of the methodology is the inclusion of an assessment protocol focused on the development of 21st century skills. This assessment protocol focuses on the collection of evidence, observation by the teacher, and the integration of data extracted from the technologies themselves (a contribution from the field of Learning Analytics). This article presents the assessment protocol designed for the project's methodological approach. This assessment protocol makes possible to assess, based on evidence, the research activities carried out by the students and their development of critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity skills. Since the development of competencies and the application of the scientific method are learning objectives common to all these disciplines. The implementation of this methodological approach is being widely welcomed by science teachers for the interdisciplinarity of learning activities, and by students for the authenticity of learning experiences. In addition, external stakeholders such as families, associations or local companies have also shown their interest in the project and have positively valued the opportunity to be part of these learning experiences. There are already several kindergarten, primary, secondary, baccalaureate and even vocational schools in Portugal, Greece and Spain, among others, that are implementing the IDiverSE methodology.

Wearable technologies, or articles of clothing that incorporate computer and advanced electronic technologies, are a popular example of making (Wu, Fan, & Mattila, 2015, p. 3). The rising popularity of these creative forms of digital production further aligns with and supports a growing emphasis on STEAM pedagogy in K-12 classrooms. Research has concentrated on student learning, but a broader discussion about pedagogy and the shifts required of teachers to co-create spaces conducive to 21st century learning must be prioritized; inquiry into teachers' experiences implementing technology into the curriculum can help fulfil this aim. This paper describes a research project conducted by university researchers within a single classroom in Ontario, Canada which investigated the potential for teacher growth in technological pedagogy and practice. The study involved the development and piloting of a wearable technology unit as part of the grade six science and technology curriculum. Students explored e-textiles, a form of wearable technology where sensors and other electronic components such as LEDs, batteries, and circuit boards are networked together and embedded in pieces of fabric or cloth (Berzowska, 2005). The study was conducted in four phases: 1) design of a wearable technology curriculum; 2) testing of the curriculum in an after-school program; 3) curriculum (re)design; and 4) classroom implementation. Data collected from phase one consisted of pre- and post-surveys, field notes, photo and video documentation, and interviews with the participating teacher; it informed the curriculum (re)design with the goal that it could be delivered by a teacher with limited additional support. Qualitative data was analyzed by thematically coding field notes and interviews with the participating teacher, with emphasis on the impressions they had about student learning, challenges they faced, and suggestions for future work in this area. While this study represents a one-off experience designing and implementing a wearable technology curriculum, it offers insight into future directions for this type of curriculum. A recurring obstacle continues to be how to support the wide range of technological confidence demonstrated by current educators; various resources must be designed to provide troubleshooting. Video/multimedia resources represent another means of supporting teacher development. Additionally, having time to see and work with curriculum materials in advance would alleviate some of the pressure less technologically-savvy teachers may have around this type of unit. Challenges therefore involve how to conceptualize curriculum interventions that are also responsive to unique teacher needs and classroom contexts.","Jenson, J; Tomin, B; Terzopoulos, T",,WOS
Path Planning System for Smart Cars Used in Education,"In this paper, we developed a path planning system for smart cars for teaching electronic engineering or computer science, which consists of the interactive platform for smart cars development and path planning. Designed by Visual C++, the interactive platform can call Matlab engine, allows users to choose path optimization algorithms such as genetic or A-star(A*) algorithm for different tasks and control smart ears through serial ports. The simulation and practice demonstrate that our interactive platform can help learners to plan paths and control intelligent vehicles without specially designing a user interface.","Xiong, GY; Niu, LL; Tian, YF; Zhou, JH; Mohajeri, B; Nyberg, TR",,WOS
Designing Spaces for Creativity and Divergent Thinking: Pre-Service Teachers Creating Stop Motion Animation on Tablets,"In recent years, tablets have been shown to serve as incredible teaching tools in classrooms around the world. In mathematics education, divergent thinking, creativity, and play may play a key role in formation of adaptive thinking and math achievement. This qualitative, participatory action research investigated the use of an instructional model that provided minimal instruction in the use of tablets to create stop motion animation movies. This study focused on the themes and patterns that emerged as pre-service teachers integrate a design thinking philosophy as they explore creativity and divergent thinking through the creation of stop motion animation movies. This study employed a participatory action research design that examined the use of an instructional approach informed by design thinking that utilized tablets to enable pre-service teachers to create stop motion animation movies and examine pedagogical implications of creativity, divergent and convergent thinking.","O'Byrne, WI; Radakovic, N; Hunter-Doniger, T; Fox, M; Kern, R; Parnell, S",10.18404/ijemst.408942,WOS
Gujarat Vidyapith: On the Way to Greening of the University,"Gujarat Vidyapith (GV), a university founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920, has a number of campuses in Ahmadabad city and other rural areas of Gujarat. Gandhi was not an environmentalist, but the lifestyle he had lived and inspires us to live, can solve many environmental problems. Of his 11 vows, 4 relate to the environment. They are Asety (non-stealing), Apaigrah (non-possession), Bread labour (work to live) and Swadeshi. The main tenets of Gandhi-Self-reliance, Swadeshi, Decentralisation and Limiting wants-also speak of environmental sustainability. Environment plays an important role in economy, viz., source, sink and services. As a source, the environment provides energy and natural resources in economic activities. The waste of these activities is released into the environment for which it acts as a sink. There are a number of environmental services-recreational and spiritual-which increase efficiency and productivity levels of an individual. Gandhi is often quoted-the Earth has enough to satisfy everybody's needs but not anyone's greed. For the last 7-8 years, GV has been trying to tread the path prescribed by Gandhi, which is now known as sustainable development (SD). The concept of SD includes the aspects of production and consumption and GV has kept both of them in mind. This chapter is divided into three sections. The first presents the case for greening the campus. The second describes various activities of GV which encompass a number of environmental aspects. It includes environment education at various levels in graduate and postgraduate courses, the water harvesting structures that GV has made, waste management by way of research in bio-gas and composting, the use of LED and solar lights and the energy park, self-sufficiency in the case of food grains and milk, construction of an auditorium which is based on the principle of green architecture, and purchase of steam cooking system and eco-friendly coolers. It would also include environmental learning by Udyog. The third and last section tries to look critically at each effort of GV with regards to environmental perspective. It also includes the future way as envisaged by the concerned individuals to make GV campus and the mindset of people working at GV more eco-sensitive.","Shukla, N; Khimani, R",10.1007/978-3-319-11961-8_18,WOS
KEY FACTORS TO DEVELOP A COMMON METHODOLOGY TOWARDS AN APPROPRIATE ENERGY MIX FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION,"For the decades to come can be foreseen that electricity and water will keep be playing a key role in the countries development, both can be considered the most important energy vectors and its control can be crucial for governments, companies and leaders in general. Energy is essential for all human activities and its availability is critical to economic and social development. In particular, electricity, a form of energy, is required to produce goods, to provide medical assistance and basic civic services in education, to assure availability of clean water, to create conducive environment for prosperity and improvement, and to keep an acceptable quality of life. The way in which electricity is generated from different resources varies through the different countries. Nuclear energy controlled within reactors to steam production, gas, fuel-oil and coal fired in power stations, water, solar and wind energy among others are employed, sometimes not very efficiently, to produce electricity. The so call energy mix of an individual country is formed up by the contribution of each resource or form of energy to the electricity generation market of the so country. During the last decade the establishment of proper energy mixes for countries has gained much importance, and energy drivers should enforce long term plans and policies. Hints, reports and guides giving tracks on energy resources contribution are been developed by noticeable organisations like the IEA (International Energy Agency) or the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and the WEC (World Energy Council). This paper evaluates energy issues the market and countries are facing today regarding energy mix scheduling and panorama. This paper revises and seeks to improve methodology available that are applicable on energy mix plan definition. Key Factors are identified, established and assessed through this paper for the common implementation, the themes driving the future energy mix methodology proposal. Those have a clear influence and are closely related to future environmental policies. Key Factors take into consideration sustainability, energy security, social and economic growth, climate change, air quality and social stability. The strength of the Key Factors application on energy system planning to different countries is contingent on country resources, location, electricity demand and electricity generation industry, technology available, economic situation and prospects, energy policy and regulation, etc.","Guerrero, F; Clemente-Jul, C",,WOS
ART THERAPY GROUPS IN THE SCHOOL SETTING: EFFECTS IN THE REDUCTION OF AGGRESSIVENESS FOR PRESCHOOL TO UPPER ELEMENTARY CHILDREN,"Art therapy is a multidisciplinary profession that combines art, psychotherapy and group therapy. We define as art therapy in the school setting: those interventions and treatments that are performed by professionally registered art therapists, within the physical space of the school, working collaboratively with other professionals in the support team such as tutors, special education specialist or counsellors. Some organizations and researchers of art therapy: [1], [2], [3] and [4], indicate that art therapy conducted in schools can be beneficial to enhance the capabilities of interaction amongst students, contributing to educational intervention and pedagogical rehabilitation. As a differentiated intervention in the school context, art therapy is also especially beneficial for children when behaviour problems are manifested within the school milieu, or other behavioural manifestations such as, aggressive; insecurity or lack of self-confidence exist [1]. While art therapy may be provided individual therapy sessions, it has also been developed to work with different types of groups, for which art therapists have adapted group therapy theories to working with art techniques and their expressive possibilities. As defined in the BASC questionnaire [5], aggressiveness is a tendency to act in a hostile manner (whether verbally or physically) threatening others. Aggressiveness in children can be a symptom underlying many different conditions: such as conduct disorders, impulsivity, psychosis, and others. It may also steam from frustration -as in the case of children who experience academic difficulties-or even from lack of coping strategies to face personal life or relationship based stressors. This work examines the effects on aggressiveness of art therapy groups in a school in Spain, for seven children from ages 6 to 11 years old. Parents of children participating in the research, completed the BASC questionnaire shortly before and after the art therapy intervention. The conclusions on the process of each child in the art therapy group, are explained individually as recorded in the sessions' notes and data registry sheets. This is followed by a statistical analysis of mean difference - by t test for paired samples - of responses to the aggressiveness scales of the questionnaire BASC. According to the parents, aggressiveness decreases significantly after treatment (t = 2.687, p = 0.036) from 55.29 points to 47 points (difference = 8.29). There is also a high correlation (greater than 0.7) between parent responses before and after treatment. By this analysis, we have found a statistically significant improvement -in parents' questionnaires-on the scale of aggressiveness. If we could have benefitted from a larger sample, the degree of significant differences found might be even greater. From the data collected in this study, we conclude that art therapy groups in the school setting can have a positive effect in reducing children's aggressiveness. Further studies may explore which would be the specific art techniques more suitable for this type of population, together with differences of treatment impact according to age of students and completed number of art therapy sessions.","di Carminati, MLAB; Peiró, AC",,WOS
