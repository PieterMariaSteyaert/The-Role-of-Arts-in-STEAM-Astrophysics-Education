Insights from bauhaus innovation for education and workplaces in a post-pandemic world,"This paper examines Bauhaus School (1919–1933) innovation and relevance today. The School is a landmark in the history of design as a discipline and the development of design education. The School was also a workplace, commercialising Bauhaus-designed products. While drawing global interest in its innovations, the School faced resistance in Germany because it challenged conventions. This problem raises the questions: How did the School-workplace generate innovations amid the calamity of post-war Germany, and what is the significance of the Bauhaus for post-pandemic education and workplaces one hundred years on? The concept of ‘transgression’ is used to understand innovation at the Bauhaus School-workplace. Haraway discusses transgressive practices that disrupt established knowledges, moving ways of thinking and doing in new directions. Analysis of workplace learning research reveals that three interfacing dimensions make up innovation: (1) workplace environments, (2) the culture-order that facilitates innovation, and (3) learning in practice in authentic settings. This qualitative case study reports on how Bauhaus innovation emerged at the intersection of these key dimensions. There are surprising commonalities between the Bauhaus approach to innovation in challenging times and contemporary thinking about supporting innovation which are relevant to education, particularly STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) education, and workplaces in a world affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. Thus, encouraging people who challenge boundaries, rules or ‘the way things are’ can support innovation. This paper addresses a gap in workplace learning research on interrelated dimensions of innovation which the Bauhaus recognized. The study also offers an innovative approach to&#xa0;the examination of innovation across time and space whereas most contemporary studies of innovation focus on the present. Further, conceptualizing innovation as transgression offers a new way of thinking about innovation in design and in the workplace.","White-Hancock, Lorraine","Bauhaus , Design , Innovation , Transdisciplinary , Transgression",Design & Applied Arts Index (DAAI),No,1.

"RISING Strong: Sustainability through Art, Science, and Collective Community Action","The objective of this research is to offer a qualitative analysis of adult STEAM (science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics) learning in a community setting, with a focus on sustainability and climate action. To date, much research on STEAM learning has been directed towards youth and children in formal educational settings. Our qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with community participants, artists, and scientists over the course of a six-month initiative in Ireland allowed us to develop a rich picture of a multi-faceted STEAM project that held space for both a social change agenda and a learning agenda. In our findings, we identified several contributing factors to transformative learning and changed feelings about climate change, including pride of place, the development of strong interpersonal relationships, and an emerging sense of collective agency through a shared emotional and affective journey. To design for meaningful, community-level climate action, we argue that learning may be supported in, with and through STEAM. Our study also showcases the value of the arts and aesthetic experiences to embrace dissensus when tackling a complex issue like climate change through STEAM education.","Hurley, Mairéad;Roche, Joseph","STEAM education , climate , environmental education , equity , justice , informal learning , non-formal learning , place-based knowledge , science communication","Coronavirus Research Database, Publicly Available Content Database",No,1.

STEM to STEAM: Effect of Visual Art Integration on Long-Term Retention of Science Content,"The current focus on STEM education is based on the idea that science, technology, engineering and math be taught in an interdisciplinary and applied approach in grades K-12. There is growing attention to integrating the arts as an equal partner to STEM learning (STEAM). The purpose of this cluster random sample experimental study was to examine the effect of visual art instruction, specifically drawing, on long-term retention of science content. Fifty-five fifth and sixth grade students participated in this study, 31 in the experimental group and 24 in the control group. Both groups received instruction based on a modified science lesson developed by Arizona State University in cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The experimental group received instruction on art techniques to be used for drawing and the development of visual notes while the control group used traditional note taking and writing. A delayed post-test revealed that the drawing group scored significantly higher for retention of content. Implications for authentic arts integration revealed by this study suggest that the arts play a significant role in learning and content retention in art and science. More significantly, the participants in this study were at the level of proficiency and labeled gifted (minimum IQ of 130), demonstrating that arts integration is effective with a more diverse population than marginalized students studied in previously investigations.","Rosen-O'Leary, Robin;Thompson, Eustace G.","Elementary Education , Grade 5 , Intermediate Grades , Middle Schools , Grade 6",ERIC,No,1.

From Interdisciplinary to Transdisciplinary: An Arts-Integrated Approach to STEAM Education,"What should science, technology, engineering, art, and math (STEAM) education look like? In the context of educational policy, the STEAM conversation has intensified and spread across the United States and some other counties (Eger, 2015; Yakman &amp; Lee, 2012). This article advocates an arts-integrated approach to STEAM education and discusses the potential of this approach for opening up a transdisciplinary space. This space will therefore be capable of fostering an ""innovated"" society. Here, the author suggests that teachers can create a transdisciplinary space in their own STEAM lessons by designing assignments that engage with multiple disciplines and thereby nourish students' ability in transferring learning in multiple disciplines.","Liao, Christine",,ERIC,No,1.

Educate Utilizing CubeSat Experience: Unified K-20 Vision of Comprehensive STEAM-Powered Space Systems Education Program,"Educate Utilizing CubeSat Experience: Unified K-20 Vision of Comprehensive STEAM-Powered Space Systems Education ProgramEducate Utilizing CubeSat Experience (EdUCE) debuted in 2010 as a K-20 Science,Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education program using space-derivedactivities with an emphasis on design and development of CubeSats. CubeSats originallywere introduced to train and expose university students and faculty to holistic spacecraftresearch and development. Recently, the inclusion of the Arts (resulting in STEAM) hasbecome a complementary effort to engage students/educators in activities and to motivateinnovation in Systems Engineering curriculum. This paper discusses a new systematicapproach which (i) utilizes a Backward Design approach to develop coherent end-to-endsystem engineering content and (ii) delivers this content through state-of-the-art digitalplatforms. Specifically, the following hypothesis-driven questions are investigated: • How does the design of the EdUCE program meet STEAM standards and expectations? • How is Systems Engineering (in particular design and development of CubeSats) correlated to the Backward Design approach that is adopted in educational curriculum? • How to use the arts to complement the understanding of STEM concepts with a focus on Systems Engineering? • How are digital platforms (i.e., interactive books, Web 2.0 and mobile apps) paired with hands-on activities an effective mechanism to enable learning? • What best practices have been targeted and implemented for dissemination of EdUCE?Backward Design approach is a tool used in elementary and secondary education to developcurricula and teaching lessons which involves the following phases: (1) determination of thelearning outcomes, (2) development of the assessments, and (3) design of the learningexperience; essentially, the process has the end in mind by first, identify the learning goals,next identify the metrics required to measure success, then finally design/implement thelearning activities to meet these goals, thus creating a systematic path. The SystemsEngineering process shares lots of parallelisms with Backward Design; it begins with a need(i.e., objective), assesses alternatives and designs and develops products and activities (i.e.,verification and validation, operations, sustainment, and retirement) to satisfy the need in asystematic way.Via this approach, educators and techinical subject matter experts collaborate in thedevelopment process and manage age appropriate curriculum, thus unifying and broadeningboth the number and quality of K-20 participants worldwide. To demonstrate, an example ofengaging curriculum is presented. The end-to-end design and development process and thelife experiences from a CubeSat program are the major contributing factors in engaging theparticipants, however, complementary space activities, such as microgravity experiments,high altitude balloon experiments, and CanSats are included. Additionally, this is integratedwith the use of digital platforms to increase the awareness and the emphasis on STEAM.","Shiotani, Bungo;Buckley, Dante Augustus;Bumbaco, Amy Elizabeth;Fitz-Coy, Norman G",,Publicly Available Content Database,Yes,,Yes
“Some Angles Are Gonna Be Weird”: Tinkering with Math and Weaving,"It has been argued that much of how math is taught in schools aligns with a particular epistemology that comes from western mathematicians and philosophers, potentially leading to an undervaluing of diverse skills and abilities. Tinkering, a common STEAM practice, is one way of participating that does not necessarily involve a straightforward path from problem to solution; rather, tinkering may be non-linear, and involve movement back and forth between known and new solutions. This process is not always supported or encouraged in traditional mathematics spaces but may be more available through activities such as crafting. This study examines a weaving workshop with middle-school students, asking the question: When and how do learners tinker in mathematical ways as they learn to weave? Video data were analyzed using qualitative techniques and perspectives informed by interaction analysis and other multimodal analytic techniques. Findings show that youth could be seen tinkering in the workshops in the forms of “negotiating and renegotiating with materials” and “trying unexpected solutions.” Examples from two focal cases break these tinkering forms down in deeper detail and showcase the mathematical engagement made possible by the space to tinker. This work sparks possibilities for designing math learning spaces that honor youths’ personally meaningful ways of doing and being both through the materials used and the practices encouraged.","Thompson, Naomi","tinkering , crafting , mathematics , STEAM , constructionism",Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

A Study of Pre-Algebra Learning in the Context of a Computer Game-Making Course,"A Study of Pre-Algebra Learning in the Context of a Computer Game-Making Course Blind SubmissionAbstractIn this paper, we report the outcomes of the first implementation of [a new pre-algebra learningcurriculum based on game design]. The curriculum is the result of a National Science Foundation[program] grant to explore novel ways to teach standards-based content and 21st century skill tounderperforming high school students in Los Angeles. The project’s goals are to addressretention, career education and secondary mathematics learning. Game design is being used toengage students and to provide a grounding context for the mathematics. The effort is meetingthe challenge of teaching math across the curriculum and is leading to the development of newstrategies to embed mathematics in authentic contexts.PedagogyLearning in the context of computer game making is best framed by the philosophy ofConstructionism, which is the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity thelearner experiences as constructing a meaningful product (Papert, 1987; also Kafai, 2008).Following a recent trend in STEM education, the program uses a STEM to STEAM (Science,Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) approach to learning, which is the practice ofintegrating art and/or design with traditional STEM learning to increase interest and impact(Maeda, 2013). The importance of the practice is being recognized at high levels (Bonamici,2013).MethodologyDuring the fall of 2011, fifty students participated in a pilot program to study mathematicslearning in the context of making computer games. During class students created two differentgames – a maze game (e.g. PacMan) and a shooting scroller game (e.g. Space Invaders). Eachgame exercised a different set of mathematical concepts. Game making classes were interspersedwith activities that involved mathematics directly, for example, including doing worksheets andplaying math games; or indirectly, for example, manipulating math concepts that occurred whilemaking games. Students took short self-quizzes after each step of the game making process toreinforce concepts. Pre and post math tests were administered before and after students createdgames. The results of learning gains from pre-test to post-test are reported on here.ResultsData from pre and post tests were analyzed The highest learning gains for the maze gameoccurred in graphing and rates concepts, as well as fractions, percentages and factors. Thehighest for the shooter game occurred in the average, length, percent and probability calculations.[Extra Page for Figures and References]ResultsFigure 1 Maze test (top) and shooter test (bottom) results.

A Study of Thermoelectric Generation Coupled with Methanol Steam Reforming for Hydrogen Production,"Waste heat recovery was considered as a promising candidate for energy conservation and emission reduction. Methanol steam reforming was considered to be an effective means for hydrogen production because of its advantages. In this work, a micro reactor was constructed and thermoelectric generation coupled with hydrogen production from methanol steam reforming was innovatively used to recycle waste heat, which was simulated by hot air from a hot air gun. The waste heat was converted into electricity and hydrogen at the same time. The characteristic of thermoelectric generation coupled with methanol steam reforming was investigated. It was experimentally verified that both the hydrogen production rate and methanol conversion increased with the increasing inlet temperature, but thermal efficiency increased firstly and then decreased with the increasing temperature. The methanol steam reforming could effectively maintain cold side temperature distribution of thermoelectric generation. In the case of the thermoelectric module (1), the highest temperature difference of 37 °C was determined and the maximum open circuit voltage of 2 V was observed. The highest methanol conversion of 64.26% was achieved at a space velocity of 0.98 h −1 when the temperature was 543 K, comprehensively considering the CO content and thermal efficiency.","Wang, Guoqiang;Wang, Feng;Guan, Delun","energy conversion , hydrogen energy , methanol steam reforming , thermal management and control , waste heat recovery",Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

Cases on Models and Methods for STEAM Education. Advances in Educational Technologies and Instructional Design (AETID) Book Series,"STEAM education can be described in two ways. One model emphasizes the arts and is not as concerned about the accuracy of the STEM fields. In the second model, STEM content is the prevailing force with a focus on accuracy, and the arts are used in limited and secondary resources for the teaching of the content. However, in order to promote creative thinking, allow for higher student engagement, and offer a more well-rounded education, a STEAM model, where science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics are equal contributors to the process of learning, is needed. ""Cases on Models and Methods for STEAM Education"" is an important scholarly resource that provides inclusive models and case studies highlighting best techniques and practices for implementing STEAM models in teaching and assists teachers as they learn to use such methods through the inclusion of practical activities for use in the classroom.

"Celestial calendar-paintings and culture-based digital storytelling: cross-cultural, interdisciplinary, STEM/STEAM resources for authentic astronomy education engagement","In D(L)akota star knowledge, the Sun is known as Wi and the Moon is Han-Wi . They have an important relationship, husband and wife. The pattern of their ever-changing relationship is mirrored in the motions of Sun and Moon as seen from our backyards, also called the lunar phases. The framework of the cultural teaching is storytelling and relationships. Cultural perspectives in astronomy such as this remind us of how indigenous ways of knowing are rooted in inclusion, engagement, and relevancy. Designed by A. Lee in 2007, the Native Skywatchers initiative seeks to remember and revitalize indigenous star and earth knowledge, promoting the native voice as the lead voice. The overarching goal of Native Skywatchers is to communicate the knowledge that indigenous people traditionally practiced a sustainable way of living and sustainable engineering through a living and participatory relationship with the above and below, sky and earth. In 2012 two indigenous star maps were created: the Ojibwe Giizhig Anung Masinaaigan -Ojibwe Sky Star Map (A. Lee, W. Wilson, C. Gawboy), and the D(L)akota star map, Makoce Wicanhpi Wowapi (A. Lee, J. Rock). In 2016, a collaboration with W. Buck of the Manitoba First Nations Resource Centre (MFNRC), produced a third star map: Ininew Achakos Masinikan - Cree Star Map Book. We aim to improve current inequities in education for native young people especially through STEM engagement, to inspire increased cultural pride, and promote community wellness. Presented here will be recently created resources such as: astronomical calendar-paintings and short videos that exist at the intersection of art-science-culture. As we look for sustainable ways to widen participation in STEM, particularly in astronomy education, part of the conversation needs to consider the place for art and culture in STEM.","Lee, Annette S;Wilson, William;Tibbetts, Jeff;Gawboy, Cark;Meyer, Anne;Buck, Wilfred;Knutson-Kolodzne, Jim;Pantalony, David",,Publicly Available Content Database,No,4.

Creating a Space for STEAM,"This study investigated seven elementary teachers as they participated in professional learning communities, co-taught, and delivered STEAM instruction to students in a rural elementary school. This multiple case study analysis highlights teacher comfort in their current placement and their capacity to implement a new curriculum. The information shared in this study explores how these teachers navigated the implementation and described their experiences. One lesson learned from this study is the difference between teacher comfort and teacher confidence. Teacher comfort comes from a place of familiarity and while positive in nature can create a teacher efficacy facade. Teacher confidence needs to be fostered for a growth mindset to lend toward true teacher efficacy. There are implications learned through this analysis for classroom teachers, teachers of STEM and administrators.

Development and Experimental Validation of a Thermoelectric Test Bench for Laboratory Lessons,"The refrigeration process reduces the temperature of a space or a given volume while the power generation process employs a source of thermal energy to generate electrical power. Because of the importance of these two processes, training of engineers in this area is of great interest. In engineering courses it is normally studied the vapor compression and absorption refrigeration, and power generation systems such as gas turbine and steam turbine. Another type of cooling and generation less studied within the engineering curriculum, having a great interest, it is cooling and thermal generation based on Peltier and Seebeck effects. The theoretical concepts are useful, but students have difficulties understanding the physical meaning of their possible applications. Providing students with tools to test and apply the theory in real applications, will lead to a better understanding of the subject. Engineers must have strong theoretical, computational and also experimental skills. A prototype test bench has been built and experimentally validated to perform practical lessons of thermoelectric generation and refrigeration. Using this prototype students learn the most effective way of cooling systems and thermal power generation as well as basic concepts associated with thermoelectricity. It has been proven that students learn the process of data acquisition, and the technology used in thermoelectric devices. These practical lessons are implemented for a 60 people group of students in the development of subject of Thermodynamic including in the Degree in Engineering in Industrial Technologies of Public University of Navarra.","Rodríguez García, Antonio;Astrain Ulibarrena, David;Martínez Echeverri, Álvaro;Aranguren Garacochea, Patricia;Pérez Artieda, Gurutze",Spain,ERIC,No,4.

Development of Spatial Abilities of Preadolescents: What Works?,"Creation in space and perception of spatial relations are important workplace skills that can be successfully developed in public education through the cooperation of art education, mathematics, and technology, the STEAM model that has been successfully employed in higher education. In a longitudinal school-based experiment, we enhanced the spatial skills of preadolescents through a STEAM-based educational programme. To design our methods of intervention in mathematics, visual arts, and information technology, we used the structure of spatial skills identified in previous studies. Developmental methods involved two- and three-dimensional visualisation tasks in real-life and virtual learning environments. We employed a pre- and post-hoc assessment design using a spatial ability task sequence standardised in Hungary that proved to be valid for assessing Slovak students as well. Authentic assessment tasks included real-life situations when visualisations of spatial relations were used for orientation and creation. Pre-test results showed significant differences between school classes: we identified high achievers and middle-to-low achievers. Our developmental programme was aimed at personalised talent development in the high-achieving classes and the general improvement of the performance of low achievers, raising insufficient pre-test results to an average post-test performance.","Szabó, Tibor;Babály, Bernadett;Pataiová, Helena;Kárpáti, Andrea","spatial skills , STEAM model , interdisciplinary education , longitudinal development","Coronavirus Research Database, Publicly Available Content Database",No,1.

Evaluation of Blended Teaching in STEAM Education Using Structural Equation Model Questionnaire Technology,"Science-technology-engineering-arts-mathematics (STEAM) education is an interdisciplinary education model that breaks the barriers between disciplines and comprehensively cultivates the problem-solving ability of students. Online education has been increasingly recognized by learners by virtue of its unlimited time and space, repeatability, and rich teaching resources. Based on the concept of STEAM education, the blended teaching model integrates the advantages of traditional teaching and online education, sustainably innovating classroom teaching and exerting a far-reaching effect on the current education and teaching reform. In this study, the related questionnaires regarding the evaluation of blended teaching effect under the perspective of the STEAM concept were combed, and questionnaire measurement questions with regard to the evaluation of blended teaching effect were then designed. The effects of online-offline teaching environment, online teaching resource, and offline teaching process in blended teaching on the learning satisfaction of college students were measured via the Structural Equation Model (SEM) questionnaire technology. Results show that the overall Cronbach's α coefficient of this questionnaire is 0.796, and the KMO value is 0.828, which is greater than 0.8, indicating the excellent reliability and validity of the questionnaire. Under the blended teaching model, the online-offline teaching environment and offline teaching process generate significantly positive effects on learning satisfaction. Online teaching resources exhibit a positive, yet insignificant, promoting effect on learning satisfaction. The study results are of important reference values for understanding and analyzing the online-offline interactions in blended teaching and identifying the main problems therein. Ultimately, the goal is to clarify the direction for improving blended teaching and designing blended teaching strategies that promote students' learning engagement, leading to practical interventions.","Cai, Jiayao","Science-technology-engineering-arts-mathematics , blended teaching , effect evaluation , Structural equation model","Coronavirus Research Database, Publicly Available Content Database",No,2.

"EXPLORIA, STEAM Education at University Level as a New Way to Teach Engineering Mechanics in an Integrated Learning Process","The objective of our research is the implementation of STEAM (Science Technology Engineering Art Mathematics) learning in the bachelor of Engineering in industrial design and product development at CEU Cardenal Herrera University through the EXPLORIA project. This article implements and develops the proposal for the first year of this bachelor, which includes 24 students aged 18–20. This article focuses on how to integrate STEAM learning within the EXPLORIA project for the improvement in the learning of the physics subject, and in particular, regarding the part of the syllabus related to mechanical engineering through different projects, challenges and milestones that allow the student to see the use in the design and development of products. The EXPLORIA project connects the competencies of the different STEAM subjects included in the bachelor, designing a learning process as a logical, sequential and incremental itinerary. Through concepts on which the fundamentals of design are based: shape, volume, color, space and structure. In particular, this article shows the adaptation made in the physical part to be able to teach the integrated mechanics part in this learning process. The complete learning was carried out through several challenges and two milestones the students had to overcome through the application of the physical knowledge learned in class. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, at the end of the paper, an ad hoc questionnaire is carried out showing the students’ assessment regarding the new teaching methodology.","Montés, Nicolás;Aloy, Paula;Ferrer, Teresa;Romero, Pantaleon D;Barquero, Sara;Alfonso Martinez Carbonell","STEAM , active methodologies , project based learning , challenge-based learning",Publicly Available Content Database,No,"3.

GeoGebra e situações que envolvem modelação numa abordagem STEAM,"In order to implement a STEAM approach including the use of technology, namely the use of interactive mathematics software GeoGebra, in mathematics classes, in the lusophone space, the materials presented here were conceived, to be implemented in a first phase among teachers. Later, with the necessary adaptations, these tasks will be applied to the students. The tasks deal with modeling situations, in two- and three-dimensional geometric problems, in order to apply GeoGebra software in its analysis to illustrate its capabilities. The different windows of this software are used, namely the 2D and 3D windows, CAS window, spreadsheet and extra two dimensional windows in order to study cutting planes in solids and some surfaces. The tasks are presented so that any user, regardless of the degree of knowledge they have of the software, can follow them, being supported in scripts with some indications of the tools and commands to use. Designed for the teaching and learning of Mathematics, from a STEAM approach, these tasks allow connections with other Sciences and the Arts, and allow the development of projects using and consolidating relevant mathematical contents. These tasks are part of the proposals of activities of the participants of the Training Courses for Trainers in GeoGebra for Portuguese Speaking Countries, which from 2019 have an impact on the STEAM approach. These courses are carried out with the high sponsorship of the Organization of Ibero-American States for Education, Science and Culture (OEI). Given the interest that the tasks have for the users of the Iberian space, as well as their dissemination at a global level, the materials initially developed in Portuguese language will be adapted for Spanish and English speakers.","J M D S Dos Santos;Silveira, A P;Trocado, A E S","History and Overview , Computers and Society",Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

Give Plants an Inch; They'll Take a Yard,"When students see mathematics as an integrated field of study, they make connections, gain a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts, and see mathematics as a whole rather than disconnected, unrelated ideas. Measurement concepts are the perfect ""seed to plant"" to show how different mathematical strands integrate within other subject areas. The integrated activity shared here allowed middle school students to engage with measurement concepts and see the application of perimeter and area in a real-world scenario. Additionally, this activity allowed students to engage in spatial reasoning by measuring a physical space and rendering a scaled drawing to plan a school garden. Integrating these types of activities helps students relate physical spaces to mental models, thereby improving their spatial reasoning. The authors integrated the arts and cultivated conceptual understanding of measurement and STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics) subjects by asking the students to create a scale drawing or map of a garden.","Vela, Katherine N.;Parslow, Michelle;Hagevik, Rita;Trundle, Kathy Cabe","Teachers , Junior High Schools , Middle Schools , Secondary Education",ERIC,No,1.

Implementation of a Playful Microproject Based on Traditional Games for Working on Mathematical and Scientific Content,"According to previous research, we consider it necessary to extend the use of games, as mediating elements, in the learning of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) contents rejected by many students. For this, we have carried out an educational research project on games, with an ethnomathematical approach, since games are an important cultural sign with mathematical and scientific potentialities. We have prepared an anthropological study and an analytical one, generating a catalogue of games from different cultures. Thus, we have verified that, starting with culture, we can get to the game, but we posed the query as to whether, starting from certain games, we could achieve enculturation, by activating mathematical and scientific content in the players. To answer this query, we have created a curricular design called ""playful microproject"" with three traditional games from different cultures and geographical contexts. The microproject was implemented with 32 participants, from 8 to 12 years old. To analyse the results of the microproject, a case study was carried out using qualitative methodology. As part of the playful microproject, the necessary materials for each game were made by hand, and the games were then played. Both the realization of the games and the act of playing showed evidence of mathematical and scientific content, although more in the act of playing. The results revealed that: (1) the three games mobilized 21 categories of analysis, made up of scientific-mathematical content; (2) the three games proved to be equivalent in strong didactic potential; (3) that the microproject provides a valuable intercultural educational approach. The contents evidenced constitute a fundamental part of the Primary Education curriculum: classify, organize, measure, and quantify items, as well as formulate hypotheses, draw conclusions, place oneself in space, and design strategies, among others. It is concluded that these games can promote scientific-mathematical enculturation in a contextualized way.","Fernández-Oliveras, Alicia;Espigares-Gámez, María José;Oliveras, María Luisa",Elementary Education,ERIC,No,1.

Insights from Bauhaus Innovation for Education and Workplaces in a Post-Pandemic World,"This paper examines Bauhaus School (1919-1933) innovation and relevance today. The School is a landmark in the history of design as a discipline and the development of design education. The School was also a workplace, commercialising Bauhaus-designed products. While drawing global interest in its innovations, the School faced resistance in Germany because it challenged conventions. This problem raises the questions: How did the School-workplace generate innovations amid the calamity of post-war Germany, and what is the significance of the Bauhaus for post-pandemic education and workplaces one hundred years on? The concept of 'transgression' is used to understand innovation at the Bauhaus School-workplace. Haraway discusses transgressive practices that disrupt established knowledges, moving ways of thinking and doing in new directions. Analysis of workplace learning research reveals that three interfacing dimensions make up innovation: (1) workplace environments, (2) the culture-order that facilitates innovation, and (3) learning in practice in authentic settings. This qualitative case study reports on how Bauhaus innovation emerged at the intersection of these key dimensions. There are surprising commonalities between the Bauhaus approach to innovation in challenging times and contemporary thinking about supporting innovation which are relevant to education, particularly STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) education, and workplaces in a world affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. Thus, encouraging people who challenge boundaries, rules or 'the way things are' can support innovation. This paper addresses a gap in workplace learning research on interrelated dimensions of innovation which the Bauhaus recognized. The study also offers an innovative approach to&#xa0;the examination of innovation across time and space whereas most contemporary studies of innovation focus on the present. Further, conceptualizing innovation as transgression offers a new way of thinking about innovation in design and in the workplace.","White-Hancock, Lorraine",,ERIC,No,4. Duplication,
Integrating Geothermal Energy Education to an Engineering Technology Curriculum,"The theory and practice of the renewable energy and the sustainability education have been directly and indirectly included as new curriculum materials in many engineering and technology programs. Solar, wind, and Hydrogen fuel cell systems are available green energy technologies supported with customized educational trainers and modules in higher education institutions. Meanwhile other clean and alternative energy technologies such as geothermal heat pumps have steadily become an energy and cost efficient alternate to traditional heating and cooling systems. This require specifically engineering technology students to better gain competencies of geothermal energy for applying industrial, residential, and commercial geothermal systems in design, installation, testing, operating, data acquisition, monitoring and troubleshooting of related geothermal systems. However, due to larger laboratory space requirements, larger physical size and the higher initial cost of geothermal energy applications, many engineering and technology institutions were not able to include them in the curriculum, therefore simulation studies were the mostly an option for students to understand geothermal heat pump design and operation. Geothermal energy is the energy contained as heat in the Earth’s interior layer. The internal structure of the Earth together with the heat transfer mechanisms inside mantle and crust plays a significant role in the geothermal energy applications. Geothermal energy, as natural steam and hot water, has been exploited for decades to generate electricity, and both in space heating and industrial processes in many countries. This paper describes the curriculum enhancement for an existing junior level alternative energy class in a B.S. in Engineering Technology program by adding geothermal energy fundamentals and applications in it. The curriculum includes; (1) the analysis of refrigeration cycle on a pressure-enthalpy diagram using pressures and temperatures measured in a FESTO Didactic geothermal heat pump system, (2) obtaining coefficient performance (COP) and the energy efficiency ratio (EER) of a geothermal heat pump using measured temperature, humidity, voltage, and current values in normal and different loading scenarios for safe and effective operation. National Instrument’s LabVIEWTM software and myDAQ data acquisition module integrated with variety of sensors are also used as modern tools for the instrumentation and interfacing of the geothermal heat pump system that resulted in increased students’ interest to a traditionally mechanical engineering and technology application. This curriculum update serves as a major and minor class for multiple degree concentrations such as ECET, construction management, safety management, and engineering design and development in the department of engineering technology. The university’s recent strong partnership with a major energy services company also makes electrical power and renewable energy curriculum central to the University and College’s strategic planning that will produce future engineering technology graduates ready for implementing renewable energy technologies and applications on their areas of concentrations.","Pecen, Reg;Yildiz, Faruk;Ulan Dakeev",,Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

Library and Student Innovation Center: Makerspace!,"The College of Engineering and Applied Science together with the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Education, and the UW Libraries developed a Library/Student Innovation Center (LIC/SIC), Makerspace, to spark student innovation, creativity, and design skills. In May 2012, Governor Mead, the State legislature, and the Wyoming Governor’s Energy, Engineering, STEM Integration Taskforce articulated a vision to propel the College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS) and the University of Wyoming to the realms of excellence in instruction, research, and service.” Part of this initiative included active learning “Makerspace” in the new Engineering Education and Research Building (EERB). Makerspace employs technology along with hands-on education to spark student innovation, creativity, design and entrepreneurship. The UW Libraries has graciously provided 2500 square feet of space to develop a prototype Library Innovation Center during the Fall 2016 semester. Lessons learned and equipment purchased will form the basis of the Student Innovation Center planned for the EERB. Ground breaking for the EERB was October 7, 2016 with a scheduled completion of Spring 2019. The goal of the LIC/SIC is to provide experiential learning space for STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) students. The LIC/SIC provides a location for students to explore ideas, complete class projects, or pursue an entrepreneurial innovation. Also, the space is available to conduct classes and workshops. The space is coordinated and managed by an onsite specialist. The Library/Student Innovation Center planning team consists of an interdisciplinary group of faculty members and students with a common interest – hands on, innovative learning. In this paper we provide detailed information in developing a Makerspace including equipment selection, staffing, funding, day-to-day operations and lessons learned. This paper serves as a useful guide for other institutions considering standing up a makerspace.","Barrett, Steven F;Dousay, Tonia A;Kerr, Tyler J;Schmidt, Larry;Gellis, Brandon Seth;Ballard, Jesse",,Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

Making Space: Teacher Perceptions of How Participation and Choice Are Mediated within Maker Education in Independent Schools,"While previous research of maker spaces has primarily been focused on public and community spaces, this dissertation looked at maker education in independent schools. Maker education often challenges traditional approaches to teaching and learning, positioning teachers more as facilitators who support students to make meaningful decisions as they realize their big ideas. In examining whether maker education is one way for independent schools to create more inclusive educational settings, this dissertation paid close attention to the pedagogical moves of maker education teachers. In order to conceptualize the power dynamics that influence the teaching and learning within maker education, this study used the construct of third space to explore pedagogical forms of power. Choice and participation are both factors that influence where power lies in a classroom. To better understand the mediating factors of choice and participation, this study used a qualitative approach to examine 17 different teachers’ perceptions of choice and participation within maker education in independent schools. This study also explored how the limitations of COVID-19 impacted the work maker education teachers did with their students. An analysis of the interviews explored how maker teachers’ practices and pedagogical moves make space for student choice and agency. The findings revealed that teacher autonomy enabled the teachers to lift up multiple ways of knowing and gave them a freedom from assigning grades, allowing them to rethink how students were assessed. The teachers’ perceptions of their approach to teaching also appeared aligned with several culturally responsive teaching (CRT) practices, positioning maker education with the potential to renegotiate what is considered legitimate knowledge and providing independent schools with one way to create more inclusive settings. An analysis of findings related to the impacts of COVID-19 revealed that teachers were able to identify several opportunities as a result of COVID-19 limitations. Having fewer materials available proved to be beneficial, time became more expansive. and students’ learning was better connected to their home-based experience. The experiences that maker education teachers described facilitating during COVID-19 present the option to do things differently when students return to in-person learning.","Bird, Kelly","Culturally responsive teaching , Independent school , Maker education , STEAM , Students of color , Third space",Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

Optimization of Steam Distillation Process and Chemical Constituents of Volatile Oil from <i>Angelicae</i> <i>sinensis</i> Radix,"In this study, the steam distillation process of volatile oil from Angelicae sinensis Radix was optimized according to the concept of quality-by-design. A homemade glass volatile oil extractor was used to achieve better cooling of the volatile oil. First, the soaking time, distillation time, and liquid–material ratio were identified as potential critical process parameters by consulting the literature. Then, the three parameters were investigated by single factor experiments. The volatile oil yield increased with the extension in the distillation time, and first increased and then decreased with the increase in soaking time and liquid–material ratio. The results confirmed that soaking time, distillation time, and liquid–material ratio were all critical process parameters. The kinetics models of volatile oil distillation from Angelicae sinensis Radix were established. The diffusion model of spherical particle was found to be the best model and indicated that the major resistance of mass transfer was the diffusion of volatile oil from the inside to the surface of the medicinal herb. Furthermore, the Box–Behnken experimental design was used to study the relationship between the three parameters and volatile oil yield. A second-order polynomial model was established, with R2 exceeding 0.99. The design space of the volatile oil yield was calculated by a probability-based method. In the verification experiments, the average volatile oil yield reached 0.711%. The results showed that the model was accurate and the design space was reliable. In this study, 21 chemical constituents of volatile oil from Angelicae sinensis Radix were identified by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer(GC-MS), accounting for 99.4% of the total volatile oil. It was found that the content of Z-ligustilide was the highest, accounting for 85.4%.","Wan, Na;Lan, Jing;Wu, Zhenfeng;Chen, Xinying;Zheng, Qin;Gong, Xingchu","Radix <i>Angelicae sinensis</i> , volatile oil , Box–Behnken design , steam distillation , extraction kinetics , design space",Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

Then, a Box–Behnken design was used to study the quantitative relationship between the three process parameters, two raw material properties, and the yield of volatile oil. A mathematical model was established with an R 2 value exceeding 0.90. Furthermore, the design space of the volatile oil yield was calculated by a probability-based method. The results of a verification experiment showed that the model was accurate and the design space was reliable. A total of 16 chemical constituents were identified in the volatile oil from mixtures of F. suspensa and L. japonica . The content of β-pinene was the highest (54.75%), and the composition was similar to that of the volatile oil of F. suspensa . The results showed that when F. suspensa and L. japonica were distilled together, the main contribution to the volatile oil was from F. suspensa . The volatile oil yield from the combination of F. suspensa and L. japonica was not higher than that from L. japonica .","Chen, Xinying;Guo, Dongyun;Gong, Xingchu;Wan, Na;Wu, Zhenfeng","<i>Forsythia suspensa</i> , <i>Lonicera japonica</i> , volatile oil , steam distillation , design space",Publicly Available Content Database,No,4.

"Promoting STEAM Learning in the Early Years: ""Pequeños Científicos"" Program","Education in the early years is an excellent space for promoting integrated learning. The STEAM education model combines Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics holistically and has gained force globally, mostly in developed countries. However, in developing countries of Latin America, STEAM education programs are incipient and still unfamiliar to many early childhood and primary school educators. ""Pequeños Científicos"" is a pioneer educational program in Chile aimed at providing extracurricular academic enrichment to students 3 to 10 years old, with a gender-empowering approach. With a cross-sectional design and integrating data from students, researchers and educators, this article documents program design and implementation issues based on a partial application of SWOT analysis grounded on strengths, weaknesses and opportunities. The strengths were identified the strongest elements that might be transferred to similar interventions, for instance, students were positively engaged in the learning processes and actively communicating their advances through diverse artistic formats. The weaknesses were mainly difficulties that can be prevented in future replication, such as teachers' management of children's behavior. Opportunities present alternatives to these types of programs to improve and grow; for example, through articulation of the courses and including children with additional needs. We call for tackling the weaknesses for more efficient application and discuss the promotion of STEAM learning in the early years in the contexts of high educational inequality for future replication in diverse contexts.","Cabello, Valeria M.;Martínez, M.

STEAM-Learning to Mars: Students’ Ideas of Space Research,"Multidisciplinarity and the enrichment of science and mathematics education toward the so-called STEAM-approach where the A stands for art, has raised a lot of academic interest in the past decade. In this study, 5th and 6th graders from the greater Helsinki area ( N = 390) participated in a several months long, Mars-colonization themed STEAM-learning intervention. Testing the students’ science knowledge using pre- and post-tests, their learning outcomes were compared to those of 5th and 6th graders from a control school ( N = 119), who during the same period studied STEM-subjects in a more traditional manner. The main factors that were taken into account during the comparisons were gender and academic achievement level. Based on only whether there was any improvement between the pre- and post-test scores, girls were found to have benefitted from the Mars-module more than boys did. While also considering the magnitude of the said improvement, no significant difference in the effectiveness of the learning module was found between genders. The group of academically highest-achieving students improved their test scores the most after participating in the STEAM-learning module. This is an important, somewhat surprising finding, as often informal, outside of school learning has been found to benefit especially students with lower grade point averages.",,"STEM to STEAM , informal learning , transversal competencies , science centre education , inquiry based , hands-on , thinking skills",Publicly Available Content Database,No,4.

Students' Multimodal Knowledge Practices in a Makerspace Learning Environment,"In this study, we aim to widen the understanding of how students' collaborative knowledge practices are mediated multimodally in a school's makerspace learning environment. Taking a sociocultural stance, we analyzed students' knowledge practices while carrying out STEAM learning challenges in small groups in the FUSE Studio, an elementary school's makerspace. Our findings show how discourse, digital and other ""hands on"" materials, embodied actions, such as gestures and postures, and the physical space with its arrangements mediated the students' knowledge practices. Our analysis of these mediational means led us to identifying four types of multimodal knowledge practice, namely orienting, interpreting, concretizing, and expanding knowledge, which guided and facilitated the students' creation of shared epistemic objects, artifacts, and their collective learning. However, due to the multimodal nature of knowledge practices, carrying out learning challenges in a makerspace can be challenging for students. To enhance the educational potential of makerspaces in supporting students' knowledge creation and learning, further attention needs to be directed to the development of new pedagogical solutions, to better facilitate multimodal knowledge practices and their collective management.","Kajamaa, Anu;Kumpulainen, Kristiina",Elementary Education,ERIC,No,1.

The Culture of Disciplines: Reconceptualising Multi-Subject Curricula,"The arts are recognised for their potential to humanise and enrich educational experience, but hold a lowly position in the hierarchy of school subject-based curricula. This limits the time, and thus the influence, they can have. Whilst schools welcome the idea of a curriculum rich with both arts and science subjects, resistance to realising this is often advanced in terms of the proportion of curriculum time required for different subjects. Arguments for STEAM education, whilst apparently challenging this and valuing the potential of the arts, have reinforced its servant role. Drawing on research into a particular project, where the perspectives of the arts and sciences inform and enrich how the other is experienced and understood, we reframe this problem. Firstly, drawing on Massey's conception of space-time, we argue that one can conceive of more than one subject occupying the same curricular space on a school timetable. Secondly, informed by Geertz, we consider what the culture of the arts and the sciences offers, suggesting that this appears to reflect what teachers have valued. We argue that foregrounding the culture of school subjects, and particularly the culture of the arts, as part of a multicultural frame can facilitate rich and engaging educational experiences. Rather than being positioned as competing for time or status in the curriculum, a focus on culture emphasises how the co-existence and interplay of multiple subjects broadens, develops and thus enriches children's educational experience. It also enables a different conception of, and thus role for, the arts in schooling.","Davies, Richard;Trowsdale, Jo",,ERIC,No,1. Space related,
The Emerging Critical Pedagogies of Dance Educators in an Urban STEAM After-School Program for Black Girls,"The preparation of urban educators has gained widespread attention across education policy, research, and practice. As US urban cities have become more diverse, the teacher workforce has not kept up, and the racial/ethnic demographics of students and teachers are disproportionately incongruent. In order to eradicate an education landscape that perpetuates white, middle-class ways of knowing and being, often at the expense of the cultural practices and cultural wealth of historically marginalized students of color, urban teacher education must be centered toward justice and rooted in critical pedagogies. The literature, albeit bleak, reveals that these perspectives must also be applied to urban dance education. Dance education programs have been significantly eliminated from urban schools over time, and although dance has historical roots in African and African diasporic cultures, dance education continues to be Eurocentric. This phenomenological case study examines the emerging critical pedagogies of undergraduate dance majors and minors who served as dance teachers in an urban Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) after-school program for 7-12-year-old Black girls. Findings reveal that (a) navigating race, place, and space; (b) mentorship and practice; and (c) critical reflection and self-efficacy were critical components of the urban dance educators' emerging critical pedagogies. Implications for urban dance education and the broader field of urban education are provided.","Allen-Handy, Ayana;Ifill, Valerie;Schaar, Raja Y.;Woodard, Monique;Rogers, Michelle","Higher Education , Postsecondary Education",ERIC,No,1.

Among them, the number of electric bicycle accidents increased the most, with 1,183 compared to 2013 and the number of persons injured also increased by 1,310 whereas the number of bicycle accident from 6,262 to 6,169. Methods: Taipei City creating a friendly, safe and secure urban environment to ride: 1. Bicycle Road Network Deployment: bicycle-exclusive lanes, walkways, bicycle and pedestrian shared path and so on in order to meet a variety of traffic needs. 2. Safe and comprehensive road environment: Set up bike stands, road surfacing, street trees, signs, (pavement) markings, dedicated signs, intersection rotation and other traffic amenities to create a safe and comfortable riding environment. To promote cycling to the station to transfer MRTs is tantamount to encouraging people to take more public transport. 3. Planning a city bicycle rental system: To provide a public rental system to expand the convenience, visibility and the community of users launched a new type of public transport - public bicycle rental system (YouBike). The Youbike started demonstration operation, initially setting up 11 station points and 500 bicycles in the peripheral regions of Xinyi District on March 1 1th, 2009, and now there are 400 station points in all districts. 4. Bicycle Safe Riding Education: Most people refuse to wear helmet protection, and do not install safety devices such as reflectors and warning lights. Causes easy collision at night. The top three reasons for bicycle accidents are not giving way according to regulations, inappropriately making U-turns (turn direction) and Breaching traffic signs and sign controls. Furthermore, wrong-way driving and Careless overstepping are also the main causes of accidents. 5. Smart transportation Setting: To build a safe environment from the appropriate space. Its city area cycle path from 41 kilometers in 2006 (16.4 for dedicated lanes and 24.6 for bicycle and pedestrian shared path) to an extended 391 kilometers in 2018 (86.7 kilometers for dedicated lanes and 304.3 for bicycle and pedestrian shared path). The number of bike stands in Taipei urban area has increased from 5,202 in 2006 to 42,121 in 2018(809%). Appropriately adjust the lane allocation ratio through management means and let the left-turning bicycle turn in a two-stage left turn. This way allows the bicycle to start earlier than the steam locomotive when the green light starts to light up. Results: The implementation results of safe bicycle transport in Taipei City effectively reduced the death and rate caused by head injuries in bicycle accidents: the number of casualties (6,262 dropped to 6,169, down 1.49%), the number of deaths (59 to 30, a drop of 49.15%) or the number of injured persons (9,099 to 8,71 1), all presented a declining trend. Conclusion: Changing car-oriented road planning, complete bicycle infrastructure, and respecting the driving awareness of bicycle users is the best protection for the public. All policies should have comprehensive safety policies to ensure personal safety. Just like separate two types of transport, the overall design of the exclusive separation bicycle road, the policy of forcing all ages riding locomotives to wear helmets, etc. In the future, we will continue to plan for self-defense special road layout, intersection ramp configuration, traffic engineering and parking and transfer facilities, so that all roads in the city are safe and friendly, and we will become the first place for bicycle safety riding. Successful experience is extended to the whole country.","Wu, Yin-Huan;Ching-Ting, Yang;Chen-Chen, Chou;Man-Lin, Chang;Ming-Yu, Hsieh;Yeh-Tzu, Kuo",,Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

Transdisciplinary Approach in Middle School: A Case Study of Co-Teaching Practices in STEAM Teams,"A call for educational reform motivated this school system to devise an enhanced version of STEM in their middle school. This case provides rich descriptions of how eighth grade middle school teachers, from multiple disciplines, enacted a STEAM team model that integrated Language Arts into STEM. These STEAM team teachers were systematically studied during field observations of 100+ class sessions using what they referred to as ""transdisciplinary co-teaching,"" flexible scheduling, and multiple types of physical spaces to further engage students. Different dimensions of co-teaching were observed. The most frequently observed was ""reconstructed,"" followed by ""predisciplinary,"" ""correlated,"" and ""shared."" Types of instruction other than ""reconstructed,"" did not fit the school's proposed definitions of ""transdisciplinary co-teaching."" Thoughts are shared on lessons learned.","Wu, Yufei;Cheng, Jiaming;Koszalka, Tiffany A.","Junior High Schools , Middle Schools , Secondary Education , Elementary Education , Grade 8",ERIC,No,1.

Actualizing the Future Sown: Mobilizing Sensemaking to Envision Technical and Political Skills in Equity-Minded STEAM Reform,"At what point will educational actors recognize the limitations and utilize the possibilities of policy implementation processes to actualize long overdue reform measures for students--particularly those from historically marginalized backgrounds? Previous literature has attended to ways schooling processes replicate persistent historical, social, economic, cultural, and political inequities that can hinder student opportunity (Bowles &amp; Gintis, 2002; Bowles et al., 2005; Carlone et al., 2015; Morales-Doyle &amp; Gutstein, 2019). Recent calls for equity- and social justice policies focus on reducing opportunity disparities that envision schools as safe places of learning and social safety nets that offer such social services as meals beyond the school day, technology such as laptops and mobile hotspots for virtual learning (de Royston et al., 2020; Greenberg et al., 2020; Ladson-Billings, 2021). Actualizing these visions of schooling requires moving beyond theoretical discussions to actualization processes through policy implementation. This qualitative investigation is a case study of an equity-oriented reform centered around Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) learning at the school district level in a historically segregated Southern community. The first permanently appointed Black superintendent in this school district envisioned STEAM equity-minded reform as one critical component of a larger school system reconfiguration plan to bring about institutional change while addressing one of the widest opportunity gaps in the state (Darling-Hammond, 2015; Lee, 1999; Mejias et al., 2021; Secada, 1989, 1994). Navigating the social and political dynamics in this Southern school district required grappling with deep-rooted educational inequities familiar across the nation alongside resistant forces pushing against institutional change (Kendi, 2016). Implementing such change depends upon individuals equipped with leadership skills who can effectively mobilize ""technical"" and ""political factors of reform"" to actualize ambitious policy initiatives like equity-minded school reform (Darling-Hammond &amp; Wise, 1985; Turner &amp; Spain, 2020). ""Technical factors"" focus on changing daily operations that occur within organizations while ""political factors"" refer to persuasive strategies like changing mindsets. Sustainable institutional reform depends on both factors in order to change individuals' mindsets and practices in school systems. Through the analytical lens of sensemaking, this inquiry captured participants' real-time interpretations as the reforms unfolded to make sense of their beliefs and actions in service of institutional change (Bridwell-Mitchell, 2020; Scott, 2005; Weick, 1995). Findings from this study suggest while equity-minded leaders should attend to ""technical factors of reform"" that alter the day-to-day work of educators, they cannot overlook ""political factors of reform"" to gain lasting support--indeed, neglecting the ""political factors of reform"" can imperil the policymaking to reform process, rendering the effort invested on the technical side moot. Recognizing this dilemma, the superintendent in this study positioned oft-overlooked actors such as curriculum specialists to assist him in navigating the multilayered school district, build community support and gather much-needed resources for the policy initiatives. The new school district leader determined that such organizational shifts would attend to technical elements of reform expected by political actors within the school district and larger community. Yet this case study highlights that political factors can often outweigh technical factors when stakeholders mobilize in response to threats to existing institutional norms. This discussion contributes to literatures concerned with policy implementation, organizational and institutional ideas, with the added layer of equity-minded changes to school reform and policy and politics with Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) education. The complex nature of this discussion coupled with multiple successes that began to alter the institutional status quo in this Southern school district is perhaps why this superintendent was seemingly forced to resign in a contentious policy environment after two years of service. In light of complex national, state, and local policymaking and implementation processes, actualizing education reform in United States educational institutions can often present difficulties (Cohen &amp; Spillane, 1992; Smith &amp; O'Day, 1990). These complex processes often reduce to educational decisions residing with school boards and superintendents attuned to the pulse of community stakeholders who hold the most political influence. This can dramatically affect decision-making processes when topics seen as ""politically charged"" arise around equity, race, and opportunity gaps (Fuhrman &amp; Elmore, 1990; Spillane, 1996; Turner &amp; Spain, 2020). This examination attends to that topic space and continuous calls for critical scholarship that produce accessible insights for educational audiences on how to actualize much-needed equity-oriented reforms (Dumas &amp; Anderson, 2014; Dumas &amp; Anyon, 2006). Ultimately, this work examines the need to mobilize sensemaking, technical, and political skills to actualize equity-minded policies into sustainable reforms when contending with institutionally resistant forces.

Curriculum Exchange: “The Art of Engineering”: a Four-Year Project-Based High School Curriculum,"Curriculum Exchange: “The Art of Engineering”: a Four-Year Project- Based High School CurriculumA teacher who is the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship is implementing a newfour-year project-based STEAM curriculum. The program is designed to give students a real-world, interdisciplinary, project-based approach to learning. The program strives to create abalance between theory and application.The course sequence includes the following dedicated classes: • 9th Grade: Engineering Technology • 10th Grade: Engineering Sculpture and Design • 11th Grade: Engineering Physics • 12th Grade: Advanced Engineering Physics and FIRST Robotics (double-length class)All classes use project-based learning, i.e., the use of classroom projects to facilitate learning andassess student competence. This instructional method provides students with complex tasksbased on challenging questions or problems that involve the students’ problem-solving, decision-making, and investigative skills. Students develop valuable research and design skills. Project-based learning promotes new learning habits that emphasize creative thinking.During their first three years of study, 100 students per grade are enrolled in an integratedproject-based curriculum that collectively covers, in an interdisciplinary fashion, the contentcontained in 1) a standard laboratory science physics course, 2) a standard visual and performingarts sculpture course, and 3) an engineering elective course. These courses are taught by a teamof five teachers, who are credentialed in physics, visual and performing arts, and engineeringtechnology. Content is covered in a completely integrated, interdisciplinary fashion. Thesequence provides credit for a year each of physical science, visual arts, and an elective.Two projects will be presented here: 1) Students construct a hanging mobile. The sculpture has multiple moving parts and is colored to enhance the form. Elements and principles of design include line, shape, color, movement, balance, and space. Students use tools associated with engineering technology such as calipers, and electronic balances. Students calculate the force of gravity acting on each object and calculate all necessary torques and forces for balance. Students fabricate fasteners that allow elements of the mobile to be adjusted during assembly. 2) Students build a programmable light sculpture. The sculpture has a metal housing that is fabricated by the students. The sculpture consists of acrylic rods, which are machined by the students and then mounted in the housing. Students will use soldering irons, build a DC circuit board and wire the components together. The rods are lighted in color from below. The housing contains an Arduino computer that controls the timing and color changes of the sculpture. The students use the open-source Arduino platform to program their light sculpture.","Sandra Hull Seale;Abo-Shaeer, Amir Muhsin",,Publicly Available Content Database,No,"3.

Defining Engineering in K-12 in North Carolina,"Defining Engineering in K-12 in North CarolinaA great deal of national attention has recently been focused on STEM (science, technology, engineering,and mathematics) education as an educational innovation. The truth is that science and mathematicshave always been taught. Technology, in the sense of instructional tools, has found its way into someplaces and not into others, and most STEM educational efforts really exclude engineering. More recentconversation has centered on so-called I-STEM, or integrated STEM, with the implication that the fourinvolved subjects are not stand-alone but really have some interdependencies. Some groups want touse the term STEAM to officially recognize the important role of the arts. What is needed going forwardis not a debate on semantics, but a true paradigm shift in education. This is the role that engineeringcan play in K-12 and beyond, using knowledge and experience to solve problems.The state of North Carolina has had a history of leadership in educational matters. North Carolinacareer and technical education (CTE) already addresses many of the engineering topics that can be socritical to teaching children to think. Unfortunately, CTE does not extend into elementary school and isseverely limited in some middle schools for budgetary reasons. CTE in high school has a distinguishedhistory. Here, however, the teaching of engineering-related topics has become strongly linked to specificengineering content classes. Other CTE courses and other programs throughout the curriculum do notcontain engineering content. Thinking of engineering, not as a discipline but as an integrator andbringer of relevance to any class, represents a true paradigm shift.This paper describes a recent effort to write educational standards for the state of North Carolina thatdefine engineering in the K-12 space. The effort began with the various standards in use in other statesand incorporated information from NAE publications, the NAEP Technological and Engineering literacyframework and the original States Career Clusters work. Over twenty separate sources were used tocraft the outline of these standards. The standards themselves will be defined as well as how they arebeing incorporated as a set of connections for other, tested, subjects in the Standard Course of Study forNorth Carolina.","Bottomley, Laura;Parry, Elizabeth A",,Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

Engineering Encounters: Creating a Prosthetic Hand,"The power of 3D printing technology has grown exponentially in just the past few years--people around the world are using 3D printers to prepare food, create tailored clothing, build cars and homes, and advance the medical field in ways that never seemed possible. In classrooms across the nation, 3D printers have become increasingly common because of their affordability and ease of use. Given the focus the ""Next Generation Science Standards"" (NGSS Lead States 2013) and the ""Standards for Technology Literacy"" (ITEA 2007) place on engineering and design, 3D printers are enabling students to create tangible design solutions and inspire models of applied science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM). Teachers have recently begun to capitalize on the benefits of using 3D printers to facilitate makerspaces--spaces where people can gather to create something or learn how to--in elementary classrooms. Allowing young students to create and innovate their own design solutions to real-world problems emulates how real science and engineering is done.

Engineering the Future Workforce Required by a Global Engineering Industry,"Engineering the Future Workforce required by a Global Engineering IndustryThe last decades have brought numerous changes to the engineering workforce. These changeshave been caused both by the increased specialization of skills required by the continuousapplication of innovative technologies and the geopolitical changes enabling global collaborationof engineering design teams. These phenomena, coupled with challenges in the workforcedemographics have created an environment requiring dramatic changes in the way that youth andadolescents in primary, secondary, and post-secondary education are educated to ensure theirfuture career success.While individual teachers have made great strides in improving the learning of their individualstudents to accommodate the requirements of a global workforce in the 21st century overallengineering companies and governmental agencies are challenged by the quantity and quality ofgraduates produced by the education system at all levels. To solve this dilemma a very largeaerospace company and a national space agency have jointly engineered a program inpartnership with educational institutions which prepares students with skills in the Science,Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) areas and does so collaborativelyacross the nation.While the very large aerospace company and governmental space agency have various educationprograms at all levels of the education system, this paper will focus on the joint efforts to engagevarious engineering universities and secondary education institutions across the United States byhaving geographically-dispersed, student teams comprised of members from various universitieswork together to solve an epic engineering challenge. These epic challenges address issues ofglobal concern, e.g., capturing and retrieving an asteroid, monitoring agricultural fields toincrease yield, or assisting first responders, and require a multidisciplinary skill set. This paperwill define the detailed processes required for such a multi-organizational endeavor, rangingfrom the recruitment and organization of partners, to the development of a joint curriculum andexecution of the program. These processes are based on the experiences, by both the very largeaerospace company and governmental space agency, in successfully carrying such multi-stakeholders initiatives within the education systems.While both organizations represented by the authors are aware of the limitations andshortcomings of the current education system, a paradigm change cannot be implementedovernight. This paper will therefor also detail how the jointly engineered program satisfiesABET criteria and will contrast benefits with traditional programs. In addition, a framework willbe presented that will enable the application of these processes to primary and secondaryeducation enabling students to have validated skills that are directly related to national scienceand engineering standards as well as workforce requirements. It is the intention of bothorganizations to leverage their respective technical expertise to engineer a multifunctionalsystems that can provide a workforce based on national objectives and industry requirements.","Richey, Michael;Zender, Fabian;Camarda, Charles J",Diversity,Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

Global root zone storage capacity from satellite-based evaporation,"This study presents an “Earth observation-based” method for estimating root zone storage capacity – a critical, yet uncertain parameter in hydrological and land surface modelling. By assuming that vegetation optimises its root zone storage capacity to bridge critical dry periods, we were able to use state-of-the-art satellite-based evaporation data computed with independent energy balance equations to derive gridded root zone storage capacity at global scale. This approach does not require soil or vegetation information, is model independent, and is in principle scale independent. In contrast to a traditional look-up table approach, our method captures the variability in root zone storage capacity within land cover types, including in rainforests where direct measurements of root depths otherwise are scarce. Implementing the estimated root zone storage capacity in the global hydrological model STEAM (Simple Terrestrial Evaporation to Atmosphere Model) improved evaporation simulation overall, and in particular during the least evaporating months in sub-humid to humid regions with moderate to high seasonality. Our results suggest that several forest types are able to create a large storage to buffer for severe droughts (with a very long return period), in contrast to, for example, savannahs and woody savannahs (medium length return period), as well as grasslands, shrublands, and croplands (very short return period). The presented method to estimate root zone storage capacity eliminates the need for poor resolution soil and rooting depth data that form a limitation for achieving progress in the global land surface modelling community.","Wang-Erlandsson, Lan;Bastiaanssen, Wim G M;Gao, Hongkai;Jägermeyr, Jonas;Senay, Gabriel B;Albert I J M van Dijk;Guerschman, Juan P;Keys, Patrick W;Gordon, Line J;Savenije, Hubert H G",,Publicly Available Content Database,No,2.

Innovating Industrial Design Curriculum in a Knowledge-Based and Participatory Digital Era,"This article narrates on three years participatory research between 2012 and 2014 and its formulation for a 2016 undergraduate industrial design curriculum launch. It contributes to design culture transformation since there are leading breakthrough education exemplars but lack of pathways to get there by conservative courses and institutions. The course proposes an individual and collective knowledge creation model through social constructivism and constructionism that recognises its place in time and history. It intends catching up with a profession transformed beyond a digital Bauhaus manifesto that bridges physical and digital artefacts, space and environments through quality of experiences, intelligence, networks and relations. Data and practice supported pedagogy redefinition from master-apprentice and teacher-centred skill transmission models to heutagogy and paragogy. The new approach required habitus change from a traditional goods-centred discipline to human-centred focus, critical design and making, design heuristics, CDIO (conceiving, designing, implementing, operating) and STEAM (science, technology, arts, mathematics) frameworks. Participants worked empathetically to contextualise, problem frame and solve by crossing boundaries between disciplines, institutions, industries, and students’ background and society. Research and practice promoted new forms of industrial design creation happening in physical and digital coexisting spaces of being. The curriculum expressed through units that evolved around an e-curriculum component working as a digital spine that progressed from standard social networking and industry collaboration to international design studio and design factory projects. It became foundation for future physical-digital industrial design artefacts, human computer interaction, machine learning, and systems built on hacker culture, shared information, free open-source software and hardware.","Novoa, Mauricio",,Design & Applied Arts Index (DAAI),No,1.

MAKER: Locomotive Steam Engine Valve Plug,"Acquiring replacement parts for ageing equipment and mechanisms has become increasingly difficult due to the lack of original engineering drawings, the variability between the machines themselves, and the low to nonexistent availability of replacements. Additionally, older machine parts tended to be single-made, versus mass produced, which further complicates finding an appropriate replacement. This is a distinct problem when dealing with ageing machines that are still in use, but cannot be easily fixed. This paper presents an example of how reverse engineering, modeling, and prototyping using a Maker Space may be employed to generate a part for an ageing steam locomotive.

Natural Nanotechnology: Examples of Creating a Culture of Outreach with Accessible and Adaptable Modules,"Many engineering faculty and students may have good intentions for conducting outreach. However, enthusiastic intentions are easily thwarted by difficulty coming up with an idea lack of preparation time, difficulty procuring materials and need for specialized space. In addition, recruiting a diverse next generation of engineers requires engaging not only K-12 students but also their families and their teachers. These groups may view engineering and nanotechnology as intimidating, difficult to comprehend, or even scary. They may also have preconceived ideas about “what an engineer looks like.” Facilitators of outreach activities can worsen these problems with overly detailed explanations, a lack of confidence in their own understanding, and/or a lack of diversity among outreach facilitators. All of these challenges can be overcome by creating a culture of outreach where faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students work as a team to develop and implement outreach activities. As students develop a passion for, and confidence in, leading outreach activities they can train other students reducing the burden on faculty time. Connecting engineering content to nature and art can overcome participant misconceptions and facilitate engagement. This paper describes two modules developed by chemical engineering and education students under an NSF Math Science Partnership Grant: 1) Why are Abalone Seashells so Strong and Shiny, and 2) Finding the Nano in the Trees. The first module was largely developed by a chemical engineering undergraduate researcher. The second module was developed by a team of education students and a chemical engineering graduate students. Both activities have been disseminated in multiple formats including the SECME Summer Institute for teachers, K-12 classrooms, university open houses, and student organizations’ outreach activities. In the abalone module, students are given antacid, calcium supplements, and baby abalone sea shells. They are asked about similarities and differences and to hypothesize which material will break most and least easily. Participants of all ages enjoy testing the toughness of the materials by dropping fishing weights through PVC pipe onto the objects. From the mass and drop height, they can determine that the “strongest” material is the thin abalone sea shell. They are then given a baked seashell, and can easily break it. This facilitates explanation of how abalone’s strength (and appearance) are the result of its nanoscale brick and mortar structure and cooking the shells weakens the mortar. Depending on the audience quantitative calculations of energy absorption can be performed, protein denaturation can be described, or biomimetic nanomaterials can be discussed in more detail. The second activity builds on chemical engineering’s long history with the paper industry. In this STEM to STEAM activity participants make decorative paper, and are then asked if there is something smaller than the pulp they used to make the paper and what would happen if they assembled this smaller material. They are then given aqueous dispersions of cellulose nanocrystals and produce birefringent iridescent films by drop casting samples on slides. The success of both modules has been related to the hands on nature of the activities, the ready availability of materials and that they can easily be implemented with little preparation using portable materials and equipment. For example, the abalone module was conducted at both a STEM after school program for at risk youth, and the Tuskegee Science and Technology Open House with less than ten minutes of preparation by the SHPE officers running the activity. It was also implemented in a more in depth format to introduce experimental design, energy calculations and unit conversions. Broad adaptation of the Nano in the Trees module has been impeded by the need for an optical microscope, but this is being overcome by using cell phone cameras and polarized film. In addition to these specific modules, national programs such as NanoDays have not only introduced numerous communities to nanotechnology they have given a diverse group of students confidence in leading outreach not only while attending a university but after graduation.","Davis, Virginia A",Diversity,Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

Scientists for Tomorrow - A Self-Sustained Initiative to Promote STEM in Out-of-School Time Frameworks in Under-served Community-Based Organizations: Evaluation and Lessons Learned,"On 2011, the Scientists for Tomorrow (SfT) Initiative started with the support of an NSF-ISE grant for a period of two years serving 15 sites. Today the initiative is in its sixth year, serving more than 40 community based organizations (CBOs) sites, 600 middle school student and 150 parents per semester in a self-sustained mode. The SfT initiative is designed to provide urban youth in Chicago with information and skills related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers and foster positive attitudes toward Stem subjects and related careers. Given that the initiative is hosted in the Department of Science and Mathematics – Columbia College Chicago, an art and media school, the contents promoted in the communities include also an Art component, changing from STEM to STEAM. The initiative is a partnership between a higher education institutions, local community based organizations (CBO’s) and local Informal Science Education providers. In the original design, the implementation of the program in the communities during the academic year, was divided into 3 sessions of 10 weeks: Fall (October-December); Winter (January- March) and Spring (April – June). Each session explores a different module such as Alternative Energies, Physics of Sound and Mathematics of Music, People and Plants, Robotics or Astronomy. Before each session starts, SfT provides more than 15 hours of professional development for all of the instructors involved in the program (staff members from the CBO’s, grad and undergrad students). Each session includes 10 meetings (once per week) of 90 minutes with an end of the module showcase the last session. At the end of each module, all of the CBO’s sites participate in a Family Science Day in one of the ISE venues partners: Museum of Science and Industry (December), Field Museum (March), and Garfield Conservatory (June). The question the initiative explores is if there are changes in participants’ and CBOs leadership attitude towards STEAM and gain of content knowledge. For this effect, participants are given a pre and post attitude test for each module per session, in order to determine their knowledge and awareness towards STEM. These tests are scored through an external evaluator and provide quality information for how to modify curriculum in the future. Additionally, all instructors are required to complete Activity Journal Logs after each of their class sessions. These internal evaluations allow instructors to reflect on their formative assessment techniques, as well as find where they needed more support. Leadership within the program reads the logs daily and reacts accordingly, providing all necessary resources. Finally, the Community Site Director, Coordinators and Volunteers are given a survey to evaluate the program as a whole, at the end of each module. These are internally analyzed to find effective improve the partnership as well as their STEAM afterschool program. The result of the four years external evaluation (two years of the grants and two years no-cost extension) shows that the initiative has a significant positive impact in the attitude toward STEM of the participants as well as in their gain of content knowledge. Also shows a significant positive change of attitude from the CBO’s leadership toward the introduction of STEAM academic enrichment activities as part of the regular activities in their OST programs. Some of the learned lessons include 1) the need to have more parental involvement in the OST activities of their children to ensure the success of the initiative, 2) have a flexible professional development and instructors follow up strategy to ensure the quality of the learning process and the growth of the CBOs capacity to continue promoting STEAM as an integral part of their OST educational offer, and 3) the need to promote the public perception that OST learning is important as formal education to promote the children, especially in under-served communities.","Caplan, Marcelo",Diversity,Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

The initial phase of theproject to demonstrate the production of biodiesel using waste vegetable oil (WVO) from campusdining services has been successfully executed by UMES student team. Under the supervision ofthe project leaders, the students have worked in teams to collect, dewater, and filter the WVO;supported the acquisition of supplies and installation of the biodiesel processor; performednecessary titration and laboratory tests on the WVO to determine appropriate amounts ofchemicals ( sodium hydroxide, methanol, and sulfuric acid) to be used with a batch of WVO inthe processor for the esterification and transesterification reactions; and operated and monitoredthe 48 hour biodiesel production and washing cycle of the processor. Besides biodiesel theprocess produces glycerin as byproduct. The glycerin has been used to produce soap successfullyby the students. Students have also tested ‘gelling’ tendency of different blends of biodiesel andare currently working with the UMES farm manager to identify and appropriately modify farmequipment for biodiesel use. Students are also working with the university safety office to refinesafety considerations to comply with OSHA and municipality requirements. Students will beinvolved in managing broader logistics of scheduling the processor operation for biodieselproduction and utilization, based on needs of the farm equipment. The project team plans torefine the processing of glycerin by-product to improve the aesthetics, fragrance, and otherqualitative parameters of the soap so that they may sell it for possible fund-raising efforts forselected student organizations.The project leaders have encouraged all “STEAM” (science, technology, engineering, agriculture,and mathematics) majors to participate in the ongoing efforts and are exploring involvement ofinterested business, human ecology, and fine-arts students to address some of the new dimensionsof the project. Maryland Space Grant Consortium has provided supplementary support forinterested undergraduate students, particularly from the underserved population to get involved.The broader scope of the project includes use of biodiesel, a carbon neutral energy source, for usewith farm equipment and as an alternative transportation fuel to address climate change andsustainable energy related issues. Furthermore, the project will continue to address use of remotesensing and advanced geospatial information technology tools to optimize use of nutrients, water,and other resources for efficient production agriculture practices that are critical to provide foodfor a growing population on the planet in a sustainable fashion.","Nagchaudhuri, Abhijit;Mitra, Madhumi;Teays, Terry John;Daughtry, Craig S T;Schwarz, Jurgen G;Marsh, Lurline",,Publicly Available Content Database,No,1.

"""Finding the Joy in the Unknown"": Implementation of STEAM Teaching Practices in Middle School Science and Math Classrooms","In response to a desire to strengthen the economy, educational settings are emphasizing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum and programs. Yet, because of the narrow approach to STEM, educational leaders continue to call for a more balanced approach to teaching and learning, which includes the arts, design, and humanities. This desire created space for science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education, a transdisciplinary approach that focuses on problem-solving. STEAM-based curricula and STEAM-themed schools are appearing all over the globe. This growing national and global attention to STEAM provides an opportunity for teacher education to explore the ways in which teachers implement STEAM practices, examining the successes and challenges, and how teachers are beginning to make sense of this innovative teaching practice. The purpose of this paper is to examine the implementation of STEAM teaching practices in science and math middle school classrooms, in hopes to provide research-based evidence on this emerging topic to guide teacher educators.","Quigley, Cassie F.;Herro, Dani","Middle Schools , Secondary Education , Junior High Schools",ERIC,No,1.

Changing the World for Good: Tech Trek Alabama Changes 8th Grade Girls’ Attitudes Towards STEM,"Changing the World for Good: Tech Trek Alabama Changes 8th Grade Girls’ Attitudes Towards STEM The American Association of University Women (AAUW) research report ”Why SoFew? Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)” found thatwomen are vastly underrepresented in STEM majors and fields compared with their male peers.But “Why So Few?” also showed that those numbers can change when girls realize theirpotential in STEM at an early age. In 2012, AAUW decided to provide girls across the countrythe opportunity to immerse themselves in hands-on exploration of STEM topics in order toencourage them to take more advanced STEM classes in high school and go on to major inSTEM fields in college. Using the model developed in California, AAUW brought Tech Trek, aweeklong summer camp for rising eighth-grade girls that is designed to develop interest,excitement, and self-confidence in STEM through classes, workshops, hands-on activities, andfield trips to four national sites in 2013.The inaugural Alabama Tech Trek camp, a partnership between the local AAUW branch andInstitution was held July 20-25, 2014. The girls spent 17.5 hours in core classes, choosing fromrobotics, app development, and life science. They also gained exposure to additional areas ofSTEM through workshops, a field trip, and evening activities. Technical workshops includedinstant challenges conducted by trained evaluators from Destination Imagination, rocket buildingand the engineering design process led by NASA Education, and DNA extraction at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. Non-technical presentations included communicating your bigidea, STEAM, and stress release. The campers also toured a prototyping facility at Dynetics, Inc.and took the Ultimate Math Field Trip challenge at the US Space and Rocket Center.

Dancing with STEAM: Creative Movement Generates Electricity for Young Learners,"The integration of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) serves to develop creative thinking and twenty-first-century skills in the classroom (Maeda 2012). Learning through STEAM promotes novelty, innovation, ingenuity, and task-specific purposefulness to solve real-world problems--all aspects that define creativity. Lisa Fanning is a fifth-grade teacher at a public elementary school with school-wide arts integration at the core of its vision. Fanning participated in a district-wide professional development project through which she partnered with a dance teaching artist. Together with her partner, she engaged in a 12-hour workshop to develop common understandings about curricular intersections, practiced co-teaching structures, and devised essential questions to guide their lesson planning. They subsequently engaged in 24 hours of additional professional development during a summer institute to learn specific methodology in dance integration, including elements, strategies, and facilitation techniques. During the summer institute, Jamie Simpson Steele (a performing arts specialist) and Lori Fulton (a science educator) provided a framework for thinking about STEAM intersections and examples of art and science integrated experiences for teachers and teaching artists. Next, Fanning and her teaching artist partner co-planned and co-taught a semester-long inquiry to investigate this question: How does energy transform? This inquiry engaged students in hands-on activities, field-based experiences, interviews with experts, science notebooks, creative movement improvisation, dance choreography, and a call for social activism. The collaborations consisted of ten sessions of planning time and ten co-taught lessons in the classroom. Fanning's unit focused on the properties of wind and how its energy could be stored, transformed, and transferred for use. The science objective required students to describe how later when they engineered turbines). To explore the relationship among the earth, sea, and sky, students connected to their personal experiences at the beach and did further observation and research. Students converted these ideas into a model by expanding, rising, and pushing their bodies through space. Finally, students responded to the work of their peers, practicing artistic thinking by observing, describing, and interpreting each other's movements (Harris 2013). The unit culminated in a public performance with invited parents and community members. During this sharing, students performed original choreography, exhibited wind turbines, led station activities to inform their guests about the wind as a source of energy, and engaged in a mock demonstration advocating for renewable energy.","Simpson Steele, Jamie;Fulton, Lori;Fanning, Lisa","Elementary Education , Grade 5 , Intermediate Grades , Middle Schools",ERIC,No,1.

"Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) Diplomacy: Preliminary Results from an Initial Pilot Course","The emergent, interdisciplinary topic of “Science Diplomacy” includes: 1) training scientists to serve as diplomats (i.e., integrating the ‘art’ of political science into the STEM disciplines to create STEAM – science, technology, engineering, art, and math), 2) empowering countries to collaborate on scientific advancement through diplomacy (i.e., CERN and the international space station), and 3) building cross-cultural relationships among scientists from different countries (i.e., Fulbright exchange in STEM disciplines). Because science diplomacy occurs at the nexus of diverse disciplines, it is simultaneously difficult for a single individual to learn the full range of topics necessary to offer such a course, and it is structurally problematic for two or more faculty from diverse academic departments (often in different colleges) to co-teach such a course (i.e., cross listing a course among a Department of Engineering and a Department of Political Science can be a challenge). Nonetheless, training students in Science Diplomacy is critically important to – inter alia – manage the global environment (i.e., polar regions, oceans, transnational freshwater, biodiversity, and atmospheric quality), to protect global health (i.e., biodefense, pandemics, and emergent infections), and to share human-made technological ecosystems (i.e., infrastructure, energy production, outer space, and the internet). Recognizing the need to bridge science and diplomacy, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) created the Center for Science Diplomacy, launched the quarterly publication, Science &amp; Diplomacy, and has begun to offer short courses and research gatherings. A very limited number of institutions have also begun to offer courses on “Science Diplomacy” – Tufts, Columbia, and NYU – and some institutions are creating MOOCs in science diplomacy – SUNY has a MOOC with a specialization in global health diplomacy. Recently, a monograph originally prepared in French was translated into English and is being marketed by Springer as a ‘text book’ for Science Diplomacy instruction. Through a Presidential initiative at our university, a new course, cross-listed between the a Department of Engineering and a Department of Political Science has been developed. The course consists of three major cognitive (knowledge) activities, including: 1) students complete low-level Bloom’s taxonomy learning (i.e., recall) through listening to pre-recorded lectures, reviewing assigned reading, and completing low-stakes, frequent online quizzes (i.e., a flipped classroom); 2) students complete high-level Bloom’s taxonomy learning (i.e., creation) through the preparation of two, term-length written documents, namely: a) the construction of a new, comprehensive case study of science diplomacy on a topic selected by the student and approved by the instructor; and b) an application for a science diplomacy fellowship/internship/scholarship (i.e., term-length inductive learning); and 3) students complete mid-level Bloom’s taxonomy learning (i.e., analysis) through completing five, one-page, essays in response to existing case studies (i.e., rubric-based grading of essays). To accommodate the diverse learning styles and preferred means of assessment for a diverse student population across multiple disciplines, course grading also includes asynchronous, regular participation in an online discussion board (i.e., course participation), a written midterm, and a written final exam all aimed at low and mid-level Bloom’s taxonomy learning. A ‘buffet approach’ is used to assign final grades with students completing a sub-set of available assignments providing ample opportunities for each student to demonstrate ‘excellence’ (i.e., ‘A’) in learning the cognitive content. To supplement the cognitive (knowledge) content, learning in the affective (attitude) domain is achieved through online journaling with self-assessment, peer feedback, and instructor evaluation. Code-word searches are used to document personal growth in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Learning in the psychomotor (skills) domain is achieved through mock negotiations among teams of students employing a Model United Nations activity. This article will present the format of the course and the results of evaluation of a pilot offering.","Oerther, Daniel B",,Publicly Available Content Database,No,1. Space related,
Visual Frictions,"The predominant approach in visual studies, explicitly focusing on how vision is socioculturally constructed, tends to neglect the physiological substrate for vision. Images, and our visual surroundings, are often considered from the premise that those dealing with them specifically see with average eyesight and that differences in seeing can be accounted for by cultural and ideological analyses. I set out to question this premise and the normalisation of vision it implies, by drawing on accounts of seeing by Conrad, a friend and colleague who sees with special requirements. His well-articulated verbal description of the requirements involved in his seeing makes it clear that our vision is tightly intertwined with visuality. Our visual surroundings are the way they are partially on account of the ability to see implied. As Conrad puts it, ""they are designed for average eyesight."" I posit that the concept of activated affordances is useful for taking into account that vision is socially constructed, as suggested in important works in visual studies, and that physiological substrates for vision exhibit variation. I will focus particularly on how the designed environment becomes an area for Conrad in which visuality is lived out differently in accordance with how this eyesight happens to manifest itself. Conrad's use of ""social hacks"" provides a case in point for discussing how Conrad activates affordances in unforeseen ways, in order to fulfil desires for socially meaningful action that does not reduce him to stereotypical behaviour when being treated as visually impaired. Maintaining that vision and visuality remain difficult to disentangle, I will argue that we all see with special requirements, even if we might not notice this. For studies of visuality, I suggest reflecting on presumed understandings of vision. The argument in textual form is complemented with a brief video that features an edited interview focusing on Conrad's account of seeing with special requirements. It is supported with visualisations representing an attempt to render aspects of his seeing. Instead of purporting to visualise exactly how he sees, I intend the imagery to provoke reflection of seeing as a complex process, mediated via our ability to see and by the social construction of what to see. 28228_UF0001.jpg Dr. Asko Lehmuskallio is a researcher at the School of Communication, Media and Theatre at the University of Tampere and at Locating Media at the University of Siegen.

More papers from this issue can be found at www.aestheticsandculture.net A short film Seeing with special requirements by Asko Lehmuskallio. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I7c8EHBkhQ&amp;feature=youtu.be The dominant approach in visual studies, explicitly focusing on how vision is socially constructed, tends to neglect the physiological substrate for vision. Studies both of images and of our visual surroundings often proceed from an implicit premise that those dealing with them see with average eyesight and that differences in seeing can be accounted for by cultural and ideological analyses. Here, I question this premise and the normalisation of vision implied, by drawing on accounts of seeing offered by Conrad, a friend and colleague who sees with special requirements. As his eloquent verbalisation of the requirements for seeing makes clear, our vision is closely intertwined with visuality.1 In part, our visual surroundings are the way they are because of the ability to see implied. As Conrad puts it, ""they are designed for average eyesight."" In the discussion that follows, I will focus particularly on how the designed environment becomes an area where visuality is lived out differently depending on the kind of eyesight one happens to have. I wish to argue that we all see with special requirements, and that our requirements linked to seeing differ, depending on our physiological substrate for vision. When attending to designed environments, we situationally adapt to prescribed ways of seeing that are culturally and ideologically formed. I suggest that the concept of activated affordances is helpful for taking into account both the physiological substrate for vision needed for seeing and the cultural and ideological formations that suggest which affordances get activated instead of others.2 The argument in textual form is complemented by a brief video that includes an edited interview focusing on an account of seeing with special requirements. The interview is supported with visualisations intended to render aspects of Conrad's seeing. Instead of claiming to visualise exactly how Conrad sees, I use the imagery to stimulate reflection of seeing as a complex process, mediated via both our ability to see and the social construction of what to see.3 A PARADOX IN VISUAL STUDIES: THE NORMALISATION OF VISION In a well-regarded preface to an edited work on vision and visuality, Hal Foster explains how scopic regimes seek to essentialise vision, naturalising and normalising a certain way to see. He maintains that although vision is based on physiological processes, it is also very much culturally and socially informed. Sight and its techniques intertwine in ways that make them difficult to disentangle, whereas vision and visuality remain woven together.4 Much of the important and influential work published in visual culture studies tends to focus on the latter, the social construction of practices related to vision and visuality, emphasising ways in which power structures, visual orders, scopic regimes, and various gazes direct our attention, our ways of looking, and the meanings that we give to what we see. In doing so, they situate observers, subjects, or bodies within nuanced patterns of power-laden and structured visual interactions.5 These studies explicitly work with the social construction of vision and constitute attempts to uncover asymmetric power structures and to counter them. While doing so, much of this work takes implicitly a particular physiological substrate of vision for granted, although influential figures such as Foster or Mitchell warn against doing so.6 In many of these studies, pictures and the mental images they occasion are deemed so powerful because people can see them. Studies on visual culture seldom reflect from this perspective the premises behind their work; paradoxically, it seems that much of the work explicitly questioning a normalised visuality as socially constructed normalises the physiological substrate of vision.7 I suggest that the concept of activated affordances is useful for understanding the intertwinement of vision and visuality, of how bodies and their environments merge within seeing, helping to point both towards affordances as a relation needed for seeing in the first place and to their activation as a particular cultural form of attention and meaning-making. James J. Gibson coined the term affordance to discuss the complementarity of animals and persons with their environments.8 Affordances, in Gibson's understanding, always describe relations between living beings and their particular environments, and these relations depend both on the living beings and on the environments in question. For example, a small mobile phone screen is perceivable, readable, and therefore usable for text messaging by those with sufficiently good eyesight (for perception and reading) and adequate motor skills (for texting) but not, for example, by many elderly individuals with poor eyesight. The latter can perceive the mobile phone's screen but, because of both poor eyesight and the limited screen size, cannot read it. The mobile phone does not afford them the same kinds of uses it affords others. Gibson's use of the notion of affordance is of assistance for pointing towards the relationality and variety of affordances, but he does not give culturally sensitive explanations addressing why some affordances are preferred over others. For accounting for cultural contextualisations, it is useful to think of activated affordances if one wishes to comprehend the actual use of particular objects, and how their use is embedded in social meanings, as Gillian Rose has proposed in her work on everyday photography.9 The focus on the activation of affordances is useful for pointing to culturally meaningful ways of interacting in visual environments. In Conrad's case, as will be shown later, there is, for example, an explicit activation of coarse-level visual features of friends and colleagues for purposes of identifying them (among these are hair type/style, colour of clothing, and ways of walking), because this kind of activation of affordances is socially meaningful. Being able to identify someone as an individual person is very much encouraged, at least in the so-called Western societies, and, for doing so, some affordances have to be activated rather than others. The affordances available depend, again, not only on the social construction of seeing but also, just as much, on the particular ways in which we are able to see. Conrad's account of the visual frictions encountered in his everyday life is useful for a discussion on how the affordances activated depend both on socially meaningful action and on the physical opportunities for action available to each of us. Mitchell has importantly pointed out that ""[i]t is not just that we see the way we do because we are social animals, but also that our social arrangements take the forms they do because we are seeing animals.""10 Unfortunately for those seeing with special requirements, many social environments continue to be designed with average eyesight in mind. SEEING WITH SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS Conrad provides a good example for a discussion on this possible normalisation of vision and the way in which it rests on particular assumptions about visualities, especially regarding designed environments. Many do not necessarily recognise that Conrad is visually impaired, because he tends to act and talk in ways that do not distinguish him from most others. Although he wears thick eyeglasses, it is not clear to many people that he actually sees very differently than many others do. Whereas he is thus able to ""blend in"" in diverse situations, he does so by activating other affordances than most people with average eyesight do. Where this possibility is not available, he finds that many have a hard time even believing him to need help when he expresses this need. I have many situations in which people don't really realize how much I see, because I have so many tricks, and I hack myself through life somehow. So a lot of times when I tell them I am visually impaired, they sort of don't believe me, and that is a really big problem for me when I try to achieve accessibility or equal behavior, or something like that.11 Conrad has created social hacks, particular activations of affordances that enable him to interact such that his special requirements in seeing are not that readily noticed. These social hacks provide him with a way of rendering his behaviour in front of others so that his actions are not constrained beforehand for reason of his vision. When acting as yet another person who sees as everyone else does, and thereby as someone who is able to navigate built environments and social situations as those with average eyesight do, Conrad allows himself to be drawn into situations that he might not enter if others made judgements in keeping with his impairments in vision. Conrad would not differ from most other people if his visual system were more commonplace. His use of the concept of seeing with special requirements implies that all human beings have particular requirements for their sensory perception and action upon the environment, and that these requirements differ from person to person, just as Gibson suggests with the notion of affordance. As the examples Conrad cites from his life experience make clear, many designed environments are geared towards those with average eyesight, disrupting their use by people with different visual systems. Even everyday utility articles and artefacts such as computers, houses, or cars are often designed for people with normalised, average vision. Conrad points out: [I]f they would be just slightly changed in their designs to meet my requirements, I wouldn't have so many problems actually getting around in the world. If I use the term 'people with special requirements', it always implies that it's not my fault that I can't do this thing at the moment or can't operate this machine or that it takes much longer, but it's actually the fault of the design, because [the problematic element or item] wasn't designed for my requirements but was designed for someone else's requirements. Here, vision and visuality intertwine in ways that show how a variety of designed environments rely on an assumption of average eyesight, a necessary condition for taking up a relation, an affordance, in the first place. Thus, designed artefacts are socially constructed to fit the requirements of particular kinds of people.12 Slight changes in designed environments could enable a better fit between Conrad's body and the material artefacts around him, but designed environments tend to be oriented towards normalised vision rather than allowing for other kinds of activations, such as Conrad's social hacks discussed below.13 Whereas, as Gibson suggests, these differences between individuals may vary significantly, too often there is the tendency to think in discreet binaries, such as normal and special, leading to design decisions that do not take variety into account.14 Acknowledging we all have special requirements in seeing is helpful for deconstructing this binary opposition. FLUID BOUNDARIES OF THE BODY We need a particular physiological substrate for vision if we are to act in environments designed for average eyesight.15 Perhaps, because of the need to adapt to these environments in order to participate in the diverse social interactions presented, devices that allow eyesight that is closer to average eyesight can be felt to be almost as necessary as parts of the body, as is the case with Conrad. Devices modifying our bodies can afford seeing and acting in environments designed for average eyesight: One's body has to be moulded if it is to fit these designed environments. Conrad makes this relation explicit by stating that ""my glasses are not really an object for me; they are more a part of my body like an arm or something like that."" His eyeglasses enable him to partake in meaningful social relations, to activate affordances he would not be able to activate without them. The boundaries of his body are described as not neatly contained but, rather, fluid, such that some material artefacts can be felt to be, in essence, body parts, not that different from an arm or fingers, for example. This understanding provides an example suitable for advancing the thesis of relationality of affordances, particularly addressing how the designed environments we act upon might mould and modify both our bodies and our understandings of them. This fluidity of bodily boundaries becomes understandable when the role of our bodies as a medium for action is underscored, as done in theories of media put forth by John Durham Peters and Hans Belting, among others.16 Our bodies, once moulded, afford novel relations to our environments, a novel fit, and this novel fit might be achieved through glasses, mobile phones, and/or other kinds of artefacts, effectively enabling the distribution and mediation of our selves.17 Action in environments designed for the requirements of average eyesight necessitates media that facilitate it. For some, the physical body itself provides a sufficient medium for doing so, being capable of adapting to the requirements of average eyesight in various environments; however, ever more people need specially fabricated eyewear in order to achieve fit with their environments. There is constant need for spectacles, contact lenses, and other media for being able to see in environments designed for average eyesight. SOCIAL HACKS Although Conrad's glasses feel more like a part of the body for him, he continues to see differently than those who by wearing spectacles approximate normal vision. When using eyeglasses, he must still rely on more prominent features of the people and objects he perceives, thereby explicitly activating affordances that he can rely upon in order to act in a socially meaningful way. Normally, I can't recognise people by their face when they are decently far away, so I use a lot of rough features, like what their body structure looks like, what kind of hairstyle they have, and how they walk. I even try to remember what clothes they wear. It's easy to recognise people by how they walk, because a lot of people walk very distinctively. When they move their upper torso, or even how the body proportions are, how long the legs are and so forth. It all influences how people walk, so this makes it very easy for me to recognise people. [...] I'm very conscious about that. Body movements, colour of clothing, and hairstyle become particularly important since they remain recognisable cues for Conrad. Although those with average eyesight too notice these aspects of those they interact with, this often remains implicit and has to be brought up directly before it is considered, as has been discussed with regard to habitus.18 This friction in fitting within designed environments and social situations whose assumptions rely on average eyesight calls particularly in unfamiliar situations for Conrad's so-called social hacking, a particular way of activating affordances, allowing him to explore novel kinds of relations that enable him to circumvent his special requirements. In social hacking, Conrad activates other affordances than people with average eyesight do, with the intention to approximate a socially accepted behaviour that does not reveal his visual impairment. When I go through the world, one technique that I use is that I always ask people a lot of things if I can't see it or get that information at the moment. So I would even ask indirectly whether something is going on in the street. If I don't see what's going on, I ask people what it is. Ordering food at a restaurant might be such a situation. If it is Conrad's first time at the restaurant and its offerings are not known to him beforehand, Conrad has to rely on a variety of techniques that those with average eyesight do not need. Since he is often unable to read the menu, which where we met (in San Francisco's Bay Area) was often behind the counter, Conrad has to socially hack. Because he cannot identify what is on offer, he has to ask for recommendations, order what someone else is eating or has ordered, just point at some food, or ask about food for special diets (such as vegetarian food). These social hacks circumvent the problem that designed environments do not always afford him the same information that these environments do for those with average eyesight. Many of these social hacks might be used by those with average eyesight as well, but then for other reasons than not being able to read the menu behind the counter. Also, computation devices allow Conrad to gather information about upcoming situations, helping him navigate in environments he cannot see. These devices allow Conrad to plan some of his actions in advance, so that he knows how to act in social situations that entail partial reliance on average eyesight. One of his situational social hacks is to look up the menu of a restaurant on that venue's Web site before going there, so that he knows what is available. The role that these devices receive in Conrad's day-to-day life has become very intimate, since they help him to expand his experiences of the environment, affording him relations he might not engage in without them. As Conrad points out, these devices become a bit like friends, in that they facilitate his every day. They help me a lot, I give an input and the machine replies. All of them actually have a name: my computer, my phone, my Kindle. I name them. They are active, they reply to what I say. Whereas, for Conrad, eyeglasses feel like a part of the body, computation devices end up taking on social roles, since they are even more integral to the many social situations he can navigate with their aid. Both glasses and computation devices enable him to activate affordances in designed environments that otherwise do not fit his requirements. CONCLUSIONS Conrad's account of visual frictions in the course of his everyday life provides a case in point for considering how the physiological substrate for vision and the social construction of visuality are intertwined. The notion of activated affordances is helpful for stressing the relationality between these two with regard to the particular environments under discussion, by enabling particular attention to be paid to why some affordances are activated instead of others. Conrad's use of social hacking is a way to circumvent some of the restrictions he has for activating affordances in environments designed for those with average eyesight. In social hacking, Conrad seeks to activate other affordances in order to act in socially acceptable and meaningful ways, without having to take up the role of being visually impaired. Instead, he can act along with others taking other primary social roles, such as that of a student, an employee, or a young man, for example. For studies in visual culture, this case provides examples for considering both the role of embodied practices and that of material environments for grasping vision and visuality. Presentation of this material in textual form and also as a multimedia narrative allows for the depiction of slightly different readings, which get experienced differently. In line with who the reader or viewer is, this text and the accompanying video afford different kinds of relations, and perhaps some of these might get activated in unforeseen ways. With his eloquent descriptions of how he experiences his surroundings, Conrad reminds me of how we all deal with special requirements, all the time. Vision tests might prove that I see in a manner conforming to the ideals behind these tests, but the test results say little about the variance in seeing that we all experience. Aching, sore eyes after a day at a monitor or when out in the wind; the eyelids closing when one is trying to remain awake; and the assault of brightness after a night in the dark woods all are ways of seeing that entail a need to adapt to designed environments if one wants to take up a relation with them, thus activating an affordance. Acknowledgements This work would not have been possible without Conrad, who patiently and articulately told me about his ways of seeing and let me use his story originally as part of the attached video. In addition, Nancy Van House was particularly helpful in encouraging work on multimedia narrations and gave me the opportunity to follow and take part in the course she was leading at UC Berkeley. I am grateful also for the encouragement I received from friends and colleagues who have seen the video, particularly John Scott and Anna Shefl. Karin Becker was very helpful when I decided to complement the original video with the above text, and various colleagues within the Nordic Network for Digital Visuality have assisted greatly by showing me ways of combining textual and visual work within an academic framework. I would also like to thank colleagues at Locating Media for thoughtful discussions. Notes 1. See also Hal Foster, ""Preface,"" in Vision and Visuality, ed.

VISUAL FRICTIONS Sensory experiences of digital photo-sharing--""mundane frictions"" and emerging learning strategies Vaike Fors* School of Education, Humanities, and Social Sciences, Halmstad University, Sweden Abstract Digital technologies are increasingly ubiquitous in everyday life forming part of the way we live and experience the world. This article will specifically scrutinise how mobile phone cameras, digital photographing and the use of web-based photo-sharing sites and communities become part of the meaning-making practices through which the everyday is lived and understood. In doing so, I advance the concept of ""mundane friction"" through which to discuss the experience, meaning-making and pedagogy generated through operating screen-based technologies. Indeed, media participates in everyday worlds beyond its role as a provider of content and for communication. The question that will be addressed here is how this media presence can be understood from an embodied and sensory perspective, and is based in a study of sensory aspects of teenagers use of web-based photo-diaries. Further, this discussion leads to questions of how an appreciation of digital visuality as more than representational acknowledges the meaning of mundane friction caused by habitually touching, rubbing, clicking, pinching through media technologies as part of the sensory emplacement process that establish people as situated learners. In turn, problematising this tangible friction as pivotal for understanding digital visuality gives reason to argue for research methods that acknowledge digital visual material as more-than-visual and theory that moves toward the unspoken, tacit and sensory elements of learning in everyday practices. Thus, the aim of this article is to elaborate on the embodied, the methodological and the pedagogical dimensions of ""mundane friction"" in meaning-making activities, and its pedagogical implications. 28237_UF0001.jpg Vaike Fors is a teacher and researcher at Halmstad University in Sweden. Her area of expertise lies in the fields of digital, visual and sensory ethnography, with a focus on pedagogical implications of everyday media practices. She has in her pursuit to contribute to further understandings of contemporary conditions for learning, studied museums and teenagers' encounters with museum and science centre exhibits in various research projects.

The potential of citizen science data to complement satellite and airborne lidar tree height measurements: lessons from The GLOBE Program,"The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program is an international science, citizen science, and education program through which volunteers in participating countries collect environmental data in support of Earth system science. Using the program’s software application, GLOBE Observer (GO), volunteers measure tree height and optional tree circumference, which may support the interpretation of NASA and other space-based satellite data such as tree height data from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation instrument. This paper describes tree heights data collected through the GO application and identifies sources of error in data collection. We also illustrate how the ground-based citizen science data collected in the GO application can be used in conjunction with ICESat-2 tree height observations from two locations in the United States: Grand Mesa, Colorado, and Greenbelt, Maryland. Initial analyses indicate that data location accuracy and the scientific relevance of data density should be considered in order to align GLOBE tree height data with satellite-based data collections. These recommendations are intended to inform the improved implementation of citizen science environmental data collection in scientific work and to document a use case of the GLOBE Trees data for the science research community.","Enterkine, Josh;Campbell, Brian A;Kohl, Holli;Glenn, Nancy F;Weaver, Kristen;Overoye, David;Danke, Deanna","citizen science , ICESat-2 , NASA GLOBE Observer , tree height , The GLOBE Program , carbon storage",Publicly Available Content Database,Yes,2.

An Experimental Study on the Implementation of a STEAM-Based Learning Module in Science Education,"Over the last decade, there has been notable academic interest in the multidisciplinary studies of science education with the emergence of STEAM. Accordingly, this study aimed to conduct an experimental study to explore the effectiveness of a STEAM-based space-themed learning module in science education taught to primary school students. The sample of the study was 6th- and 7th-grade students from the Central Anatolia Region of Turkiye. The experimental group consisted of 180 students, whereas the control group consisted of 94 students. The STEAM-based learning module was applied to the students in the experimental group, and the traditional lecture-based approach was applied to students in the control group. The traditional education and intervention lasted eight weeks. The chi-square test and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the differences and associations between the variables. The results indicated that gender and academic achievement level were the two key factors determining the effectiveness of the STEAM-based learning module. The comparison of the pre-test and post-test scores indicated that the scores of the female students who participated in the module increased the most. This suggested that girls benefited more from the STEAM-based learning module than boys. Further, the lecture-based approach led to a decrease in some high-achieving students. The findings have implications for educational policymakers, curriculum developers, and syllabus designers.","Arpaci, Ibrahim;Muhammed Said Dogru;Kanj, Hassan;Ali, Nawaf;Bahari, Mahadi","STEAM , informal learning , science education , transversal competencies",Publicly Available Content Database,Yes,,
Astro-animation: A case study of art and science education,"Art and science are different ways of exploring the world, but together they have the potential to be thought-provoking, facilitate a science–society dialogue, raise public awareness of science and develop an understanding of art. For several years, we have been teaching an astro-animation class at the Maryland Institute College of Art as a collaboration between students and NASA scientists. Working in small groups, the students create short animations based on the research of the scientists who are going to follow the projects as mentors. By creating these animations, students bring the power of their imagination to see the research of the scientists through a different lens. Astro-animation is an undergraduate-level course jointly taught by an astrophysicist and an animator. In this article, we present the motivation behind the class, describe the details of how it is carried out and discuss the interactions between artists and scientists. We describe how such a programme offers an effective way for art students, not only to learn about science but to have a glimpse of ‘science in action’. The students have the opportunity to become involved in the process of science as artists, as observers first and potentially through their own art research. Every year, one or more internships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center have been available for our students in the summer. Two students describe their experiences undertaking these internships and how science affects their creation of animations for this programme and in general. We also explain the genesis of our astro-animation programme, how it is taught in our animation department and we present the highlights of an investigation of the effectiveness of this programme we carried out with the support of an NEA research grant. In conclusion, we discuss how the programme may grow in new directions, such as contributing to informal STE(A)M learning.",[AUTHOR]Arcadias Laurence[/AUTHOR][ORCID]0000-0002-5062-0238[/ORCID][AUTHOR]Corbet Robin H.

"Celestial calendar-paintings and culture-based digital storytelling: cross-cultural, interdisciplinary, STEM/STEAM resources for authentic astronomy education engagement","In D(L)akota star knowledge, the Sun is known as Wi and the Moon is Han-Wi. They have an important relationship, husband and wife. The pattern of their ever-changing relationship is mirrored in the motions of Sun and Moon as seen from our backyards, also called the lunar phases. The framework of the cultural teaching is storytelling and relationships. Cultural perspectives in astronomy such as this remind us of how indigenous ways of knowing are rooted in inclusion, engagement, and relevancy. Designed by A. Lee in 2007, the Native Skywatchers initiative seeks to remember and revitalize indigenous star and earth knowledge, promoting the native voice as the lead voice. The overarching goal of Native Skywatchers is to communicate the knowledge that indigenous people traditionally practiced a sustainable way of living and sustainable engineering through a living and participatory relationship with the above and below, sky and earth. In 2012 two indigenous star maps were created: the Ojibwe Giizhig Anung Masinaaigan-Ojibwe Sky Star Map (A. Lee, W. Wilson, C. Gawboy), and the D(L)akota star map, Makoce Wicanhpi Wowapi (A. Lee, J. Rock). In 2016, a collaboration with W. Buck of the Manitoba First Nations Resource Centre (MFNRC), produced a third star map: Ininew Achakos Masinikan-Cree Star Map Book. We aim to improve current inequities in education for native young people especially through STEM engagement, to inspire increased cultural pride, and promote community wellness. Presented here will be recently created resources such as: astronomical calendar-paintings and short videos that exist at the intersection of art-science-culture. As we look for sustainable ways to widen participation in STEM, particularly in astronomy education, part of the conversation needs to consider the place for art and culture in STEM.","Lee, Annette S;Wilson, William;Tibbetts, Jeff;Gawboy, Carl;Meyer, Anne;Buck, Wilfred;Knutson-Kolodzne, Jim;Pantalony, David","Physics Education , History and Philosophy of Physics , Physics and Society",Publicly Available Content Database,Yes,,
Is There Deep Learning on Mars? STEAM Education in an Inquiry-Based Out-of-School Setting,"Learning intervention based on a ""Mars and Space"" exhibition was designed according to STEAM-education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) principles and practices in order to bridge the gap between formal and informal learning. The cognitive learning of 12-year-old students in Finland (""N"" = 306) showed a sustained level for a six months period. The results of this study provided evidence that situational motivation was enhanced by interest in school science in the STEAM science exhibition context. This led to better cognitive learning results in the post-knowledge test. Thus, interest and situational motivation were the first steps, and the superficial situational motivation seemed to successfully change into content-based intrinsic motivation with longer-lasting, deep learning outcomes. STEAM intervention apparently produced long-term learning, and this exhibition learning setting is shown to provide an appropriate platform to reach the deeper layers to successfully retain knowledge. Boys' scores rose even in the delayed test. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) to assess the effects on individual, motivational and situational interest in learning, situation motivation is shown to work as a catalyst and acting as a catalyst and also acted as a stepping stone for intrinsic motivation as part of relative autonomy (RAI) and a deep learning strategy.","Salmi, Hannu S.;Thuneberg, Helena;Bogner, Franz X.",Elementary Education,ERIC,Yes,,
Low-Cost Astrophotography with a Smartphone: STEAM in Action,"Astrophotography has been responsible for the discovery of planets, solar systems, stars, and several other celestial objects, which directly helps with expanding our knowledge about the universe and creating scientific models for nature. Practical techniques have been extensively described, including Covington, who has published an extensive guide to amateur astrophotography. Furthermore, aiming to introduce such important scientific activity among students, several authors have described possibilities of using the technique in physics and astronomy teaching. However, the proposed activities and methods normally need expensive equipment, such as telescopes, professional cameras, mounts, tripods, optical components, and other items not commonly owned by teachers, students, or the general public. The ubiquity of the smartphone, especially among students, makes it interesting for educational purposes. The device can be used as a mobile laboratory due to the several integrated sensors. Furthermore, the possible uses in classroom are extensive, including the ones involving astronomical subjects, especially with the use of its camera for sky imaging. In this work, we propose a simple and low-cost technique for the practice of astrophotography using the smartphone. Moreover, we suggest teaching activities involving the STEAM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math), including the analysis of the Earth's rotation and the artistic treatment of the astrophotographs.","Paula, Marcos Emanuel;Micha, Daniel Neves",,ERIC,Yes,,
STEAM-Learning to Mars: Students' Ideas of Space Research,"Multidisciplinarity and the enrichment of science and mathematics education toward the so-called STEAM-approach where the A stands for art, has raised a lot of academic interest in the past decade. In this study, 5th and 6th graders from the greater Helsinki area (N = 390) participated in a several months long, Mars-colonization themed STEAM-learning intervention. Testing the students' science knowledge using pre- and post-tests, their learning outcomes were compared to those of 5th and 6th graders from a control school (N = 119), who during the same period studied STEM-subjects in a more traditional manner. The main factors that were taken into account during the comparisons were gender and academic achievement level. Based on only whether there was any improvement between the pre- and post-test scores, girls were found to have benefitted from the Mars-module more than boys did. While also considering the magnitude of the said improvement, no significant difference in the effectiveness of the learning module was found between genders. The group of academically highest-achieving students improved their test scores the most after participating in the STEAM-learning module. This is an important, somewhat surprising finding, as often informal, outside of school learning has been found to benefit especially students with lower grade point averages.","Piila, Erna;Salmi, Hannu;Thuneberg, Helena",Elementary Education,ERIC,Yes,,
STEAM: Choreographing the Phases of the Moon,"STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) lessons have leaned heavily on the visual arts in interdisciplinary preservice learning. For preservice teachers, the application of STEAM pedagogies encourages complexity of thought connecting with their past and new experiences as well as greater self-awareness and risk-taking. Preservice teachers and elementary school students are introduced into the communicative and dynamic power of the arts through creative interdisciplinary teamwork in STEAM lessons. To enhance the impact of arts integration, dance/movement has the potential to add a kinetic connection to the study of the changing phases of the moon. Neuroscientists have begun to focus on physical movement as a means to demystify how the brain coordinates with the body to perform complex precise movements that express emotion and convey meaning (Hanna 2015). Choreographing movement most closely mirrors the actual progressive changes of the appearance of the moon in the night sky. This article describes a K-6 preservice course in which the content and activities included dance/movement and the making of visual art as props to teach about the eight phases of the moon over the course of a month combined with the nightly journey of the moon across the sky.","Fattal, Laura;An, Heejung","Higher Education , Postsecondary Education , Elementary Education",ERIC,Yes,,

The project focuses mainly on 7- to 12-year-olds, which is a key age group for creating a lifelong interest in science. The main aim of the SSA project is to provide cross-curricular STEAM activities that reinforce science learning, ignite curiosity, encourage questioning and develop creativity.","Mason, Helen",Elementary Education,ERIC,Yes,,
Where in the World? A Mars Rover Globally Collaborative STEAM Project,"When people were forced to isolate themselves physically during the pandemic, many new connections sprung up through the Internet. In order to promote this newfound global oneness and to facilitate global education, this article examines a STEAM activity that promotes a holistic approach to education and make way for a global citizenry as students and educators collaborate to discover solutions to the most pressing worldwide issues. This activity was undertaken by a fifth-grade teacher in Houston, Texas, working with a group of about eight students and their teacher from a school in Sao Paolo, Brazil. The students in the United States were working on a unit about matter and identifying materials through observations and measurements. A focus on engineering practices facilitated the global collaboration. The mission was to build a rover that will be able to travel on Mars. The activity was executed remotely with the goal of promoting a shared collaborative partnership between the American and Brazilian teams. The teams from two different locales need to share ideas to make a prototype that will travel for at least one meter. The object is for them to create the same rover within each group through their discourse. To further encourage cultural exchange and promote ecofriendly and affordable construction, they were encouraged to use recyclable materials. The activity can be adapted to different grades and places, depending on the teacher's preference and location of the international partnership.","Iqbal, Shazia;Miller, Jocelyn;Smith, Walter","Teachers , Elementary Education , Grade 5 , Intermediate Grades , Middle Schools",ERIC,Yes,,
Live Contact with the International Space Station from School,"The Royal Masonic School for Girls made history in February 2016 when it became the first school to establish a video link with the International Space Station via amateur radio--the result of a competition run by ARISS. Six girls from year 9 (age 13-14 years) qualified for Foundation Amateur Radio Licences, and students across the school took part in space-related activities during the buildup to the link-up. During the 10 minute link-up, made possible by the ARISS UK Operations team, students could see Tim on a big screen and asked him prepared questions covering space activities and careers; the event was also streamed live. This unique event provided considerable insight into ""physics in action"" and visits by speakers from the European Space Agency, defence, aerospace and security agency QinetiQ, Airbus, and a former student now at the UK Space Agency, have enthused our students about science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) careers.","Timoney, Natalile","Secondary Education , United Kingdom",ERIC,Yes,,
Students' Planetarium,"Our students built a full-size, mobile planetarium in three weeks. The planetarium was built with commonly available, cheap construction materials. Our priorities were mobility, possibility of quick assembly and reassembly and the students' availability of materials in every place in the world. The students calculated all the parameters of the planetarium's construction themselves, chose materials of appropriate technical parameters, built the planetarium's framework, elaborated the methods of projections and sounding. Taking into consideration the spectators' comfort they also designed systems of air conditioning and cooling. The project is completely consistent with the STEM and even the STEAM method. The artistic factor of the students' work was revealed during the visualisation of planetarium projections and its adornment. The final product of their work is a functional planetarium and a manual for its construction.","Brozis, Mirosaw;Swiderski, Kamil",Poland,ERIC,Yes,,
