| Improved Cognitive Skills | R_1 |
|---|---|
| Learning New Technical Skills | R_2 |
| Increased Autonomy Development | R_3 |
| Increased Intrinsic Motivation | R_4 |
| Tackling Complex (Multilevel) Problems | R_5 |
| Improved Soft Skills of Participants | R_6 |
| Effective Science Communication & Citizen Engagement | R_7 |
| Limited to No Impact on Scientific Research | R_8 |
| Ideation and Enhancement of Innovation | R_9 |
### RA1
| R_2 | Isabella Potenziani, a participant in the 2018 Astro-animation internship, had previously worked with stop-motion and 2D animation... learned to use Maya for 3D modeling. |
|---|---|
| R_5 | Participants are not only required to learn complex scientific concepts but also to reinterpret these concepts creatively. |
| R_6 | Collaboration requires effective communication, particularly as the scientists are not familiar with the world of animation. |
| R_7 | The primary goal... is to make the complex and often abstract concepts of astrophysics accessible and engaging to the public. |
| R_8 | In our surveys and interviews, there is little evidence of the art students affecting the actual research. |
### RA2
| R_2 | ...allowed NSW to develop resources and deliver community-based programming |
|---|---|
| R_4 | I used to look up and see the Greek constellations... but now I know that there are stars up there that are ours. It does something to me inside to have that relationship with the stars. It’s like finding a long-lost relative. |
| R_7 | The overarching goal of Native Skywatchers is to communicate the knowledge that indigenous people traditionally practiced a sustainable way of living and sustainable engineering |
### RA3
| R_1 | In fact this student-centered and interactive approach with a well devised eVscope program contributes to improve student learning and knowledge acquisition better problem solving and analytical thinking skills |
|---|---|
| R_2 | By the start of the second week they were able to operate the eVscope by themselves |
| R_3 | This PBL person-centred and interactive approach has produced great enthusiasm and led to excellent learning autonomy skills |
| R_6 | It was demonstrated that the students were able to prepare and conduct the session by themselves they were not only capable of operating the eVscope but they were already able to help the people in the audience to install and use the app to get and share images in real time |
### RA4
| R_1 | The cognitive learning of 12-year-old students in Finland (N = 306) showed a sustained level for a six months period |
|---|---|
| R_3 | Using structural equation modelling (SEM) to assess the effects on individual motivational and situational interest in learning situation motivation is shown to work as a catalyst and acting as a catalyst and also acted as a stepping stone for intrinsic motivation as part of relative autonomy (RAI) and a deep learning strategy |
| R_4 | Thus interest and situational motivation were the first steps and the superficial situational motivation seemed to successfully change into content-based intrinsic motivation with longer-lasting deep learning outcomes |
### RA5
| R_2 | Controlling manually the settings of the smartphone’s camera is the most important part of the technique |
|---|---|
### RA6
| R_4 | On one side space can bring motivation to people learning STEM and we saw that arts should be added into the picture because best specialists in space have been proven to be open minded and great creators |
|---|---|
| R_5 | Twenty-first century complexity results from massive sociotechnical interconnectivity communication and interaction among a larger number of entities and consequently requires new approaches departing from 20th century reductionism toward complexity analysis and improvement of familiarity with complex systems and definition of new infrastructures and functions |
| R_9 | Therefore STEAM education programs should bring such creativity and abduction skills and knowledge |
### RA7
| R_1 | Testing the students’ science knowledge using pre- and post-tests their learning outcomes were compared |
|---|---|
| R_4 | The project’s approach was driven by a motivation to foster everyday creativity in students |
| R_6 | group work, leadership etc. |
| R_9 | In this study, we attempt to find out whether a Mars-colonialization themed multidisciplinary learning module helped students develop their 21st-century skills. |
### RA8
| R_1 | Movement is an effective cognitive strategy to improve memory and retrieve and enhance learner motivation and morale, thereby strengthening learning |
|---|---|
### RA9
| R_1 | The construction of the mobile planetarium remarkably improved the students’ skills. They had to solve many different problems in a short period of time. |
|---|---|
| R_2 | The final product of their work is a functional planetarium and a manual for its construction |
| R_5 | they had to solve many different problems in a short period of time. |
| R_6 | During this time the students learnt to plan their work to cooperate |
### RA10
| R_2 | Use the engineering design process to develop a viable vehicle that can drive across Mars. |
|---|---|
| R_3 | Every effort was made to maintain each student’s and team’s autonomy to promote the construction and exchange of knowledge. |
| R_4 | This increased their motivation as they became the driving force and enhanced the success of the collaboration. |
| R_6 | As students share the challenges and accomplishments... they build interpersonal skills as well as self-confidence. |
| R_9 | co-creating a product not only promotes higher-order thinking... supports 21st-century essential skills. |
