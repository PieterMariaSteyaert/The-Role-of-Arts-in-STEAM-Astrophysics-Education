| IL_8 | In addition, a one-year traveling exhibit (2017-2018) showcases this work |
| IL_9 | Across the state, over 40 art-focused NSW workshops have been delivered |
| IL_12 | Venues included community centers, history/culture museums, schools, parks, libraries, art galleries, and medical clinics |
| IL_13 | Participants are given the materials to carve their own animal clan |
### RA3
| IL_6 | More importantly they learnt about the importance of a dark sky and its relation to the local history: night navigation was essential in a region where transhumance was in a not so distant past an important seasonal activity and where old trade routes between mountainous villages were established using sky reference points |
|---|---|
| IL_7 | During the afternoon period the students also collected information, curiosities or interesting myths about the objects |
| IL_9 | On the first night it was explained to the students how to collimate and how to focus the eVscope. Night after night they repeated these procedures with progressively less intervention from the supervisors |
| IL_10 | The telescope used in our activities is the Unistellar eVscope (4.5-inch 'enhanced Vision telescopes') |
| IL_11 | Each day during a couple of hours in the afternoon, the students prepared a list of objects to observe during the night... Particular attention was paid to careful observation planning |
### RA4
| IL_8 | The context was a mobile interactive mathematics exhibition called "Mars & Space" supported by a planetarium program, designed by the Ontario Science Centre and modified for Heureka, the Finnish Science Centre |
|---|---|
| IL_9 | The exhibition allowed students to use, test, explore, and learn in their own way during a 90-minute timeframe, followed by a 25-minute planetarium presentation |
| IL_12 | the exhibition as part of routine out-of-school education |
### RA5
| IL_3 | The artistic potential of astrophotography can be explored from the beginning of the teaching project but it is more pronounced in the editing of the images |
|---|---|
| IL_5 | Astrophotographs were taken using a single smartphone, a low-cost stand (assembled by the authors), and a remote-control system |
| IL_6 | All the discussions brought by astrophotography involv- ing the sky objects and their movements, and the historical aspects of astronomy related to the ancient cultures, among others, enrich scientific classrooms. |
| IL_9 | In the classroom activities proposed we emphasize the identification of celestial objects and constellations using sky simulation software |
| IL_10 | n this work, we propose a simple and low-cost technique for the practice of astrophotography using the smartphone |
| IL_12 | framing the sky scenarios |
| IL_13 | Artistic teaching activities with astrophotography... The artistic potential of astrophotography can be explored from the beginning of the teaching project |
### RA6
| IL_1 | during the design of what became NASA Space Exploration Vehicle we worked with artists and cartoonists who helped us visualize possible scenarios |
|---|---|
| IL_2 | during the design of what became NASA Space Exploration Vehicle we worked with artists and cartoonists who helped us visualize possible scenarios |
| IL_4 | we worked with artists and car- toonists, who helped us visualize possible scenarios |
| IL_14 | Design thinking which involves ideation, storytelling, actual design, agile development, and delivery of solutions |
### RA7
| IL_1 | During some of the activities all the schools participated in the students would work in groups adding hands-on elements and creativity into learning about Mars and the challenges they would expect to face during the imagined colonization process. |
|---|---|
| IL_3 | However the key element was to support and supplement traditional science education by art languages skills and humanities i.e. expanding the STEM into STEAM. |
| IL_7 | students developed and presented stories about their own ideas plans and proposals for Mars-travel were utilized. |
| IL_9 | During some of the activities all the schools participated in the students would work in groups adding hands-on elements and creativity into learning about Mars and the challenges they would expect to face during the imagined colonization process |
| IL_12 | The pupils and the teachers used and applied especially informal learning and out-of-school education such as visits to planetarium, museum and science centre exhibition study trips, environmental education, and workshops |
| IL_15 | School classes were planning their own trip to Mars in hopes of introducing creative approaches into STEAM-education in order to generate alternative ideas and strategies within scientific enquiry and critical reasoning |
| IL_16 | such as Augmented Reality solutions and international learning platform where students developed and presented stories about their own ideas plans and proposals for Mars-travel were utilized |
| IL_18 | such as Augmented Reality solutions and international learning platform where students developed and presented stories about their own ideas plans and proposals for Mars-travel were utilized |
### RA8
| IL_1 | Collaborative work within teams |
|---|---|
| IL_3 | To enhance the impact of arts integration, dance/movement has the potential to add a kinetic connection to the study of the changing phases of the moon |
| IL_9 | reordering and employing critical thinking to correctly align team members holding the hula hoops with the sequen- tial images of the moon’s phases |
| IL_13 | Each team was to cover each side of the hula hoop with one phase of the moon using the black and white paper and masking tape to secure the large paper to the hula hoops |
| IL_17 | In this article, the authors describe how dance/movement provides a kinesthetic anchor into the teaching of the moon phases within a STEAM lesson |
### RA9
| IL_1 | During this time the students learnt to plan their work to cooperate and to surmount the problems |
|---|---|
| IL_4 | The artistic factor of the students’ work was revealed during the visualisation of planetarium projections and its adornment. |
| IL_8 | The mobile planetarium was presented at the international conference... |
| IL_10 | The projection is displayed inside the dome using the mirror [2] or fisheye lens [3]. |
| IL_12 | The projection is displayed inside the dome using the mirror [2] or fisheye lens [3]. |
| IL_16 | The projection is displayed inside the dome using the mirror [2] or fisheye lens [3]. |
### RA10
| IL_1 | An innovative model of co-constructive collaboration was emphasized based upon the Student Global Interdependence in Science Continuum |
|---|---|
| IL_5 | Teams were building testing a prototype and redesigning their rovers through the experimental design. |
| IL_6 | To further encourage cultural exchange and promote eco-friendly and affordable construction they were encouraged to use recyclable materials. |
| IL_9 | Teams were building testing a prototype and redesigning their rovers through the experimental design |
