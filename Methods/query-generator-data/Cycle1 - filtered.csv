The potential of citizen science data to complement satellite and airborne lidar tree height measurements: lessons from The GLOBE Program,"The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program is an international science, citizen science, and education program through which volunteers in participating countries collect environmental data in support of Earth system science. Using the program’s software application, GLOBE Observer (GO), volunteers measure tree height and optional tree circumference, which may support the interpretation of NASA and other space-based satellite data such as tree height data from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation instrument. This paper describes tree heights data collected through the GO application and identifies sources of error in data collection. We also illustrate how the ground-based citizen science data collected in the GO application can be used in conjunction with ICESat-2 tree height observations from two locations in the United States: Grand Mesa, Colorado, and Greenbelt, Maryland. Initial analyses indicate that data location accuracy and the scientific relevance of data density should be considered in order to align GLOBE tree height data with satellite-based data collections. These recommendations are intended to inform the improved implementation of citizen science environmental data collection in scientific work and to document a use case of the GLOBE Trees data for the science research community.","citizen science , ICESat-2 , NASA GLOBE Observer , tree height , The GLOBE Program , carbon storage"
An Experimental Study on the Implementation of a STEAM-Based Learning Module in Science Education,"Over the last decade, there has been notable academic interest in the multidisciplinary studies of science education with the emergence of STEAM. Accordingly, this study aimed to conduct an experimental study to explore the effectiveness of a STEAM-based space-themed learning module in science education taught to primary school students. The sample of the study was 6th- and 7th-grade students from the Central Anatolia Region of Turkiye. The experimental group consisted of 180 students, whereas the control group consisted of 94 students. The STEAM-based learning module was applied to the students in the experimental group, and the traditional lecture-based approach was applied to students in the control group. The traditional education and intervention lasted eight weeks. The chi-square test and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the differences and associations between the variables. The results indicated that gender and academic achievement level were the two key factors determining the effectiveness of the STEAM-based learning module. The comparison of the pre-test and post-test scores indicated that the scores of the female students who participated in the module increased the most. This suggested that girls benefited more from the STEAM-based learning module than boys. Further, the lecture-based approach led to a decrease in some high-achieving students. The findings have implications for educational policymakers, curriculum developers, and syllabus designers.","STEAM , informal learning , science education , transversal competencies"
Astro-animation: A case study of art and science education,"Art and science are different ways of exploring the world, but together they have the potential to be thought-provoking, facilitate a science–society dialogue, raise public awareness of science and develop an understanding of art. For several years, we have been teaching an astro-animation class at the Maryland Institute College of Art as a collaboration between students and NASA scientists. Working in small groups, the students create short animations based on the research of the scientists who are going to follow the projects as mentors. By creating these animations, students bring the power of their imagination to see the research of the scientists through a different lens. Astro-animation is an undergraduate-level course jointly taught by an astrophysicist and an animator. In this article, we present the motivation behind the class, describe the details of how it is carried out and discuss the interactions between artists and scientists. We describe how such a programme offers an effective way for art students, not only to learn about science but to have a glimpse of ‘science in action’. The students have the opportunity to become involved in the process of science as artists, as observers first and potentially through their own art research. Every year, one or more internships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center have been available for our students in the summer. Two students describe their experiences undertaking these internships and how science affects their creation of animations for this programme and in general. We also explain the genesis of our astro-animation programme, how it is taught in our animation department and we present the highlights of an investigation of the effectiveness of this programme we carried out with the support of an NEA research grant. In conclusion, we discuss how the programme may grow in new directions, such as contributing to informal STE(A)M learning.","astro-animation , STEM , STEAM , animation , astronomy , education"
"Celestial calendar-paintings and culture-based digital storytelling: cross-cultural, interdisciplinary, STEM/STEAM resources for authentic astronomy education engagement","In D(L)akota star knowledge, the Sun is known as Wi and the Moon is Han-Wi. They have an important relationship, husband and wife. The pattern of their ever-changing relationship is mirrored in the motions of Sun and Moon as seen from our backyards, also called the lunar phases. The framework of the cultural teaching is storytelling and relationships. Cultural perspectives in astronomy such as this remind us of how indigenous ways of knowing are rooted in inclusion, engagement, and relevancy. Designed by A. Lee in 2007, the Native Skywatchers initiative seeks to remember and revitalize indigenous star and earth knowledge, promoting the native voice as the lead voice. The overarching goal of Native Skywatchers is to communicate the knowledge that indigenous people traditionally practiced a sustainable way of living and sustainable engineering through a living and participatory relationship with the above and below, sky and earth. In 2012 two indigenous star maps were created: the Ojibwe Giizhig Anung Masinaaigan-Ojibwe Sky Star Map (A. Lee, W. Wilson, C. Gawboy), and the D(L)akota star map, Makoce Wicanhpi Wowapi (A. Lee, J. Rock). In 2016, a collaboration with W. Buck of the Manitoba First Nations Resource Centre (MFNRC), produced a third star map: Ininew Achakos Masinikan-Cree Star Map Book. We aim to improve current inequities in education for native young people especially through STEM engagement, to inspire increased cultural pride, and promote community wellness. Presented here will be recently created resources such as: astronomical calendar-paintings and short videos that exist at the intersection of art-science-culture. As we look for sustainable ways to widen participation in STEM, particularly in astronomy education, part of the conversation needs to consider the place for art and culture in STEM.","Physics Education , History and Philosophy of Physics , Physics and Society"
Is There Deep Learning on Mars? STEAM Education in an Inquiry-Based Out-of-School Setting,"Learning intervention based on a ""Mars and Space"" exhibition was designed according to STEAM-education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) principles and practices in order to bridge the gap between formal and informal learning. The cognitive learning of 12-year-old students in Finland (""N"" = 306) showed a sustained level for a six months period. The results of this study provided evidence that situational motivation was enhanced by interest in school science in the STEAM science exhibition context. This led to better cognitive learning results in the post-knowledge test. Thus, interest and situational motivation were the first steps, and the superficial situational motivation seemed to successfully change into content-based intrinsic motivation with longer-lasting, deep learning outcomes. STEAM intervention apparently produced long-term learning, and this exhibition learning setting is shown to provide an appropriate platform to reach the deeper layers to successfully retain knowledge. Boys' scores rose even in the delayed test. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) to assess the effects on individual, motivational and situational interest in learning, situation motivation is shown to work as a catalyst and acting as a catalyst and also acted as a stepping stone for intrinsic motivation as part of relative autonomy (RAI) and a deep learning strategy.",Elementary Education
Low-Cost Astrophotography with a Smartphone: STEAM in Action,"Astrophotography has been responsible for the discovery of planets, solar systems, stars, and several other celestial objects, which directly helps with expanding our knowledge about the universe and creating scientific models for nature. Practical techniques have been extensively described, including Covington, who has published an extensive guide to amateur astrophotography. Furthermore, aiming to introduce such important scientific activity among students, several authors have described possibilities of using the technique in physics and astronomy teaching. However, the proposed activities and methods normally need expensive equipment, such as telescopes, professional cameras, mounts, tripods, optical components, and other items not commonly owned by teachers, students, or the general public. The ubiquity of the smartphone, especially among students, makes it interesting for educational purposes. The device can be used as a mobile laboratory due to the several integrated sensors. Furthermore, the possible uses in classroom are extensive, including the ones involving astronomical subjects, especially with the use of its camera for sky imaging. In this work, we propose a simple and low-cost technique for the practice of astrophotography using the smartphone. Moreover, we suggest teaching activities involving the STEAM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math), including the analysis of the Earth's rotation and the artistic treatment of the astrophotographs.",
STEAM-Learning to Mars: Students' Ideas of Space Research,"Multidisciplinarity and the enrichment of science and mathematics education toward the so-called STEAM-approach where the A stands for art, has raised a lot of academic interest in the past decade. In this study, 5th and 6th graders from the greater Helsinki area (N = 390) participated in a several months long, Mars-colonization themed STEAM-learning intervention. Testing the students' science knowledge using pre- and post-tests, their learning outcomes were compared to those of 5th and 6th graders from a control school (N = 119), who during the same period studied STEM-subjects in a more traditional manner. The main factors that were taken into account during the comparisons were gender and academic achievement level. Based on only whether there was any improvement between the pre- and post-test scores, girls were found to have benefitted from the Mars-module more than boys did. While also considering the magnitude of the said improvement, no significant difference in the effectiveness of the learning module was found between genders. The group of academically highest-achieving students improved their test scores the most after participating in the STEAM-learning module. This is an important, somewhat surprising finding, as often informal, outside of school learning has been found to benefit especially students with lower grade point averages.",Elementary Education
STEAM: Choreographing the Phases of the Moon,"STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) lessons have leaned heavily on the visual arts in interdisciplinary preservice learning. For preservice teachers, the application of STEAM pedagogies encourages complexity of thought connecting with their past and new experiences as well as greater self-awareness and risk-taking. Preservice teachers and elementary school students are introduced into the communicative and dynamic power of the arts through creative interdisciplinary teamwork in STEAM lessons. To enhance the impact of arts integration, dance/movement has the potential to add a kinetic connection to the study of the changing phases of the moon. Neuroscientists have begun to focus on physical movement as a means to demystify how the brain coordinates with the body to perform complex precise movements that express emotion and convey meaning (Hanna 2015). Choreographing movement most closely mirrors the actual progressive changes of the appearance of the moon in the night sky. This article describes a K-6 preservice course in which the content and activities included dance/movement and the making of visual art as props to teach about the eight phases of the moon over the course of a month combined with the nightly journey of the moon across the sky.","Higher Education , Postsecondary Education , Elementary Education"
The Art and Science of Creativity,"The SunSpaceArt (SSA) project, led by the author, a solar scientist at the University of Cambridge, comprises a diverse team of scientists and visual artists who run STEAM (STEM + Arts) workshops in schools, space camps and at other venues (museums, science centres and so on). The project focuses mainly on 7- to 12-year-olds, which is a key age group for creating a lifelong interest in science. The main aim of the SSA project is to provide cross-curricular STEAM activities that reinforce science learning, ignite curiosity, encourage questioning and develop creativity.",Elementary Education
Where in the World? A Mars Rover Globally Collaborative STEAM Project,"When people were forced to isolate themselves physically during the pandemic, many new connections sprung up through the Internet. In order to promote this newfound global oneness and to facilitate global education, this article examines a STEAM activity that promotes a holistic approach to education and make way for a global citizenry as students and educators collaborate to discover solutions to the most pressing worldwide issues. This activity was undertaken by a fifth-grade teacher in Houston, Texas, working with a group of about eight students and their teacher from a school in Sao Paolo, Brazil. The students in the United States were working on a unit about matter and identifying materials through observations and measurements. A focus on engineering practices facilitated the global collaboration. The mission was to build a rover that will be able to travel on Mars. The activity was executed remotely with the goal of promoting a shared collaborative partnership between the American and Brazilian teams. The teams from two different locales need to share ideas to make a prototype that will travel for at least one meter. The object is for them to create the same rover within each group through their discourse. To further encourage cultural exchange and promote ecofriendly and affordable construction, they were encouraged to use recyclable materials. The activity can be adapted to different grades and places, depending on the teacher's preference and location of the international partnership.","Teachers , Elementary Education , Grade 5 , Intermediate Grades , Middle Schools"
Educate Utilizing CubeSat Experience: Unified K-20 Vision of Comprehensive STEAM-Powered Space Systems Education Program,"Educate Utilizing CubeSat Experience: Unified K-20 Vision of Comprehensive STEAM-Powered Space Systems Education ProgramEducate Utilizing CubeSat Experience (EdUCE) debuted in 2010 as a K-20 Science,Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education program using space-derivedactivities with an emphasis on design and development of CubeSats. CubeSats originallywere introduced to train and expose university students and faculty to holistic spacecraftresearch and development. Recently, the inclusion of the Arts (resulting in STEAM) hasbecome a complementary effort to engage students/educators in activities and to motivateinnovation in Systems Engineering curriculum. This paper discusses a new systematicapproach which (i) utilizes a Backward Design approach to develop coherent end-to-endsystem engineering content and (ii) delivers this content through state-of-the-art digitalplatforms. Specifically, the following hypothesis-driven questions are investigated: • How does the design of the EdUCE program meet STEAM standards and expectations? • How is Systems Engineering (in particular design and development of CubeSats) correlated to the Backward Design approach that is adopted in educational curriculum? • How to use the arts to complement the understanding of STEM concepts with a focus on Systems Engineering? • How are digital platforms (i.e., interactive books, Web 2.0 and mobile apps) paired with hands-on activities an effective mechanism to enable learning? • What best practices have been targeted and implemented for dissemination of EdUCE?Backward Design approach is a tool used in elementary and secondary education to developcurricula and teaching lessons which involves the following phases: (1) determination of thelearning outcomes, (2) development of the assessments, and (3) design of the learningexperience; essentially, the process has the end in mind by first, identify the learning goals,next identify the metrics required to measure success, then finally design/implement thelearning activities to meet these goals, thus creating a systematic path. The SystemsEngineering process shares lots of parallelisms with Backward Design; it begins with a need(i.e., objective), assesses alternatives and designs and develops products and activities (i.e.,verification and validation, operations, sustainment, and retirement) to satisfy the need in asystematic way.Via this approach, educators and techinical subject matter experts collaborate in thedevelopment process and manage age appropriate curriculum, thus unifying and broadeningboth the number and quality of K-20 participants worldwide. To demonstrate, an example ofengaging curriculum is presented. The end-to-end design and development process and thelife experiences from a CubeSat program are the major contributing factors in engaging theparticipants, however, complementary space activities, such as microgravity experiments,high altitude balloon experiments, and CanSats are included. Additionally, this is integratedwith the use of digital platforms to increase the awareness and the emphasis on STEAM.",
Live Contact with the International Space Station from School,"The Royal Masonic School for Girls made history in February 2016 when it became the first school to establish a video link with the International Space Station via amateur radio--the result of a competition run by ARISS. Six girls from year 9 (age 13-14 years) qualified for Foundation Amateur Radio Licences, and students across the school took part in space-related activities during the buildup to the link-up. During the 10 minute link-up, made possible by the ARISS UK Operations team, students could see Tim on a big screen and asked him prepared questions covering space activities and careers; the event was also streamed live. This unique event provided considerable insight into ""physics in action"" and visits by speakers from the European Space Agency, defence, aerospace and security agency QinetiQ, Airbus, and a former student now at the UK Space Agency, have enthused our students about science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) careers.","Secondary Education , United Kingdom"
Students' Planetarium,"Our students built a full-size, mobile planetarium in three weeks. The planetarium was built with commonly available, cheap construction materials. Our priorities were mobility, possibility of quick assembly and reassembly and the students' availability of materials in every place in the world. The students calculated all the parameters of the planetarium's construction themselves, chose materials of appropriate technical parameters, built the planetarium's framework, elaborated the methods of projections and sounding. Taking into consideration the spectators' comfort they also designed systems of air conditioning and cooling. The project is completely consistent with the STEM and even the STEAM method. The artistic factor of the students' work was revealed during the visualisation of planetarium projections and its adornment. The final product of their work is a functional planetarium and a manual for its construction.",Poland
