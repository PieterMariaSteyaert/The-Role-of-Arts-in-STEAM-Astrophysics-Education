"""From Atoms to Stars"": An Interactive Theatre Play Based on 'The Little Prince' Novella to Describe Spatial Thinking","The implementation of theatre as a didactic tool for teaching science provides a new perspective on the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in the construction of meaningful learning experiences. Gamification and collaborative work are functional strategies to teach scientific concepts in a creative way. However, there are still conceptual issues about spatial thinking that are difficult for students to understand owing to the lack of visualization of objects and their development through a characteristic chronicle. Here we show an innovative way to unifying science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) careers through the development of an interactive theatrical play inspired by ""The Little Prince"" novella, to promote a culture of integration of science, theatre and literature. One of the more significant findings to emerge from this study is that the didactic strategies used are key ingredients in order to design an unique theatre play based on a link between history of atomic models and literature towards full understanding of spatial macroscales and microscales thinking. Due to the successful in the qualitative assessment results, we are devising to continue exploring the use of these didactic strategies to achieve an integrated and greater impact on students' learning processes.",False,Yes,,,2861162486,EJ1354857,,Scholarly Journals,,"Acuña-Umaña, K.;Gómez-Quirós, Carla;Herrera-Sancho, Oscar Andrey",,,,,,10.1088/1361-6552/ac6eb5,"Report , Article",,,2022,,0031-9120,4,English,English,,,,2022,Physics Education,"Scholarly Journals , Reports",2022.0,https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/0031-9120,"ERIC, © IOP Publishing",54,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/atoms-stars-interactive-theatre-play-based-on/docview/2861162486/se-2?accountid=14480,,,,,"Higher Education , Postsecondary Education , High Schools , Secondary Education",,,,,"10805ER3 3283ER3 6691ER3 10756ER1 3270ER1 6663ER1 , 9493ER3 5331ER3 9452ER1 5309ER1 , 11006ER3 4079ER3 5006ER3 6069ER3 10956ER1 4062ER1 4985ER1 6042ER1 , 5458ER3 6691ER3 5436ER1 6663ER1 , 9510ER3 9469ER1 , 4344ER3 5980ER3 4325ER1 5956ER1 , 11516ER3 1734ER3 11460ER1 1733ER1 , 6225ER3 5006ER3 6069ER3 6198ER1 4985ER1 6042ER1 , 2110ER3 6006ER3 1734ER3 2107ER1 5981ER1 1733ER1 , 4858ER3 5006ER3 6069ER3 9969ER3 9507ER3 4837ER1 4985ER1 6042ER1 9926ER1 9466ER1 , 7305ER3 8013ER3 8000ER3 7097ER3 9507ER3 6069ER3 7272ER1 7978ER1 7965ER1 7065ER1 9466ER1 6042ER1 , 10078ER3 2ER3 10035ER1 2ER1 , 6006ER3 1734ER3 5981ER1 1733ER1 , 7295ER3 4016ER3 8515ER3 6225ER3 5006ER3 6069ER3 6218ER3 7262ER1 4001ER1 8478ER1 6198ER1 4985ER1 6042ER1 6191ER1 , 3935ER3 3920ER1 , 11286ER3 1831ER3 10457ER3 8149ER3 4625ER3 11231ER1 1829ER1 10411ER1 8114ER1 4605ER1 , 4824ER3 9575ER3 10457ER3 8149ER3 4625ER3 4803ER1 9534ER1 10411ER1 8114ER1 4605ER1 , 4185ER3 4414ER3 4166ER1 4394ER1 , 2255ER3 5980ER3 2252ER1 5956ER1 , Costa Rica","Higher Education , Postsecondary Education , High Schools , Secondary Education",,https://libkey.io/libraries/1768/openurl?genre=article&amp;au=Acu%C3%B1a-Uma%C3%B1a%2C+K.%3BG%C3%B3mez-Quir%C3%B3s%2C+Carla%3BHerrera-Sancho%2C+Oscar+Andrey&amp;aulast=Acu%C3%B1a-Uma%C3%B1a&amp;issn=00319120&amp;isbn=&amp;title=%22From+Atoms+to+Stars%22%3A+An+Interactive+Theatre+Play+Based+on+%27The+Little+Prince%27+Novella+to+Describe+Spatial+Thinking&amp;jtitle=Physics+Education&amp;pubname=Physics+Education&amp;btitle=&amp;atitle=%26quot%3BFrom+Atoms+to+Stars%26quot%3B%3A+An+Interactive+Theatre+Play+Based+on+%27The+Little+Prince%27+Novella+to+Describe+Spatial+Thinking&amp;volume=54&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=&amp;date=2022&amp;doi=10.1088%2F1361-6552%2Fac6eb5&amp;sid=ProQuest,ERIC

21st Century Community Learning Centers: A Descriptive Evaluation for 2012-2013,"This evaluation study provides descriptive information about the implementation and outcomes of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (CCLC) program in West Virginia, from September 2012 through May 2013. The report draws on information from online surveys of directors of 30 CCLC programs and from school teachers for 4,102 participating students. Most participating students were in the elementary grades. The mean number of days students attended ranged from about 2 to 93 days, depending on the program. Teachers perceived the greatest improvements in participating students' behaviors related to promptness and quality of homework turned in, overall academic performance, and participation in class. Regarding CCLC program volunteers, the largest sources were K-12 service learning programs, parents and faculty members, local businesses, and postsecondary service learning programs. The groups with which program directors reported the greatest level of success were ""other"" (100%) and service learning K-12 (99.7%). Regarding work with partners, the two most frequent types of support received from partners were programming and resources. Partnerships engaged in funding, programming, resources, and training were reported to be the most effective. Regarding professional development, the topics best attended by program directors were programming, STEM/STEAM, and program evaluation. As for parent and community involvement, more than half of program directors indicated they either had no family components in their programs or that they were, at best, well below target goals. Of those who reported success in this area, three main themes emerged as reasons for their successes: (a) the right types of activities; (b) ongoing, even daily contact with parents; and (c) a shared commitment to the program, which involved engaging parents in meaningful work toward program goals. Program directors reported offering more than 600 substance abuse prevention activities, involving more than 7,000 students and nearly 1,600 adults. Nearly three quarters of program directors found the continuous improvement process for after school moderately or very helpful. Likewise, the great majority found the West Virginia Department of Education monitoring visits moderately or very helpful. The following are appended: (1) Teacher Questionnaire; (2) Program Director Questionnaire; and (3) Program Directors' Comments.

A Pandemic as the Mother of Invention? Collegial Online Collaboration to Cope with the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This article aims to present how music teachers in Sweden used the facebook group ""Musiklärarna"" in the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March and April, 2020) to cope with challenges related to teaching music. The study is based on Biesta's perspective on the teacher profession. With the consent of the participants, we have analysed the 303 posts (and their comments) that directly addressed the COVID-19 situation during that period. We found that the group works as an important collegial forum and that the teachers pragmatically use the group to solve educational problems; further, the posts concerning work-conditions get the most engagement. The most frequent types of posts concerned how to design teaching situations under the new conditions. Specifically, ""asking questions,"" ""sharing material,"" ""asking for material"" and ""letting off steam"" were the most common types. Music teachers seem to be loyal, collegial and intent on solving any challenge to facilitate students' learning as regulated in the syllabus. We hope this article can motivate other researchers to perform similar studies or build on our results.

A Place for Art and Design Education in the STEM Conversation,"The recent push for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education introduces (through the emphasis on engineering) a ""design process"" to science classrooms; some educators have also pushed for the ""artistic or creative process"" becoming a part of STEM education. In certain cases, this might be an opportunity for greater prominence for art education, better art and STEM learning, and heightened student engagement; in others it might weaken each discipline and confuse the boundaries between different approaches. In what follows we describe the possibilities and pitfalls of an approach that infuses both the creative process and design thinking into a new iteration of STEM education that adds arts (with a capital ""A"") to the acronym to make STEAM.

"A review of the effect of integrated STEM or STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) education in South Korea","Integrated STEAM education in South Korea is an approach to preparing a quality STEM workforce and literate citizens for highly technology-based society. Through a literature review, this study examined the STEAM education initiative in South Korea and investigated its effects on learning and teaching. Studies in South Korea found that teacher professional development courses increased teachers’ recognition of the initiative as well as their confidence in teaching STEAM. Teacher interviews showed that coaching in classroom practices within teachers’ professional development was helpful. Although studies reported that many science teachers adopted STEAM in science teaching, there was a lack of research on how teachers taught STEAM lessons, let alone the connections between teachers’ perceptions of STEAM and their classroom practices. As for STEAM effects on student learning, a number of meta-analyses showed that students’ experiences with STEAM were effective in both cognitive and affective learning. The effect was higher in affective domains. Interviews with college students who had STEAM experiences in grade school showed that the effects could be long-term.

Agrotechnical indicators of working bodies for tillage of fallow fields in summer,"The article discusses the options of working bodies for tillage of steam fields in the summer. These studies are aimed at obtaining agrotechnical indicators of the technological process of tillage of steam fields. In particular, the design of the working body in the form of a flat one-sided paw is proposed. Laboratory and field studies were carried out to determine the qualitative indicators of the technological process of fine tillage, with all variants of working bodies. During the research, such indicators were established as: the optimal (recommended) speed of the unit, the depth of tillage by working bodies, the width of the unit (working), the average square deviation in the depth of processing and the width of the grip. The aggregate composition of the soil was assessed by fractions, the content of erosive-hazardous particles before and after the passage of the unit, pruning or destruction of weeds and the ridge of the field surface after the passage of the unit. Data on the dynamics of soil moisture after several treatments of steam fields with various variants of working bodies were obtained. As a result of the research, it was found that the working body in the form of a flat one-sided paw, in comparison with the working body of a serial steam cultivator, allows to reduce the depth of processing by 1.6 cm (up to 5.2 cm), to reduce the value of the combiness of the treated surface by 2.4-3.4 cm, while ensuring complete pruning of weeds both annual and perennial. The variants of working bodies considered in the article for processing steam fields in the summer and the studies carried out to determine their quality indicators will allow creating machine-technological units for promising mechanized technologies of tillage in arid agriculture.",False,No,1.

Analysis of teachers’ difficulties in implementing STEM approach in learning: a study literature,"STEM approach in learning is applicable in the 21st century in which it promotes 4C skills: communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. The implementation of STEM increases the productivity of the learning process in responding to the challenges of the industrial revolution 4.0. Because it is relatively new in Indonesia, the application of the STEM approach in learning has certain difficulties for teachers. This study aims to determine the difficulties faced by Indonesian mathematics and science teachers in implementing STEM in recent five years. Based on seven main articles compared in this study, the difficulties faced by teachers in implementing STEM or STEAM are varied depending on its main focus (mathematics or science). The most common obstacle faced by mathematics teachers are finding real-life contexts of abstract topic in mathematics. While, the main difficulty experienced by science teachers are insufficient comprehension toward STEM and the limitation of time. Moreover, both mathematics and science teachers shared common difficulties as follows: low understanding about STEM, the lack of facilities and limited time provided in learning schedule. Therefore, to overcome teachers’ difficulties mentioned before, several solutions are offered depends on the needs such as increasing teachers’ comprehension toward STEM, completing school facilities and adjusting curriculum targets under the implementation of STEM.",False,No,1.

Combined Steady-State and Dynamic Heat Exchanger Experiment,"This paper describes a heat-transfer experiment that combines steady-state analysis and dynamic control. A process-water stream is circulated through two tube-in-shell heat exchangers in series. In the first, the process water is heated by steam. In the second, it is cooled by cooling water. The equipment is pilot-plant size: heat-transfer areas of 0.542 and 2.96 m2 and process-water flowrates up to 65 kg/min. The steady-state analysis involves checking energy balances around both hot and cold sides of both heat exchangers after measurements of flowrates, temperatures and pressures have been made. Redundant temperature measurements that do not give exactly the same values require the students to consider data reconciliation methods to ensure theoretically consistent energy balances. Overall heat-transfer coefficients are calculated for both heat exchangers over a range of process-water flowrates. Wilson plots are constructed to determine inside film coefficients, which are compared with predictions of applicable correlations. The dynamic analysis involves step and relay-feedback tests to determine experimental dynamic information for the system. There are two temperature controllers. The first controls the temperature of the process water leaving the heater by manipulating the steam flowrate. The second controls the temperature of the process water leaving the cooler by manipulating the cooling-water flowrate. The dynamic performances of various controller tuning methods are evaluated. Experimental dynamics are compared with dynamic simulations using Aspen Dynamics.",False,No,1.

Computer Assisted Proofs and Automated Methods in Mathematics Education,"This survey paper is an expanded version of an invited keynote at the ThEdu'22 workshop, August 2022, in Haifa (Israel). After a short introduction on the developments of CAS, DGS and other useful technologies, we show implications in Mathematics Education, and in the broader frame of STEAM Education. In particular, we discuss the transformation of Mathematics Education into exploration-discovery-conjecture-proof scheme, avoiding usage as a black box . This scheme fits well into the so-called 4 C's of 21st Century Education. Communication and Collaboration are emphasized not only between humans, but also between machines, and between man and machine. Specific characteristics of the outputs enhance the need of Critical Thinking. The usage of automated commands for exploration and discovery is discussed, with mention of limitations where they exist. We illustrate the topic with examples from parametric integrals (describing a ""cognitive neighborhood"" of a mathematical notion), plane geometry, and the study of plane curves (envelopes, isoptic curves). Some of the examples are fully worked out, others are explained and references are given.",False,No,1. Space related,,2788896542,,,Working Papers,,Thierry Noah Dana-Picard,,,,"© 2023.

Convergence – an Engineering and Arts Education Project that Brings Together Faculty and Students of Different Disciplines and Nationalities,"Engineering and art were not always completely separate disciplines. Take Leonardo da Vinci (born 1452) for example, who was equally as great an artist as an engineer. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in efforts to bring these disciplines more closely together by adding the Arts back into STEM education – or moving from STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) to STEAM (science, technology, arts, engineering, and math). Engineering may give you the skills to design and build, but the Arts will give you the ability to design and build for the human condition. This paper describes a 6 month long engineering and arts education project we’ve named Convergence. The project, made up of a multi-disciplinary and multi-national faculty and student team, involves the design and manufacture of 100 smart LED lighted miniature vessels that float down the river a river with two different colors only to converge to one color further downstream. The convergence of the vessels themselves is symbolic of the convergence of the disciplines and nationalities of the people who designed and built the project and indicative of how combining engineering with the arts can help impart a social message – the need for convergence in a disparate world. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: We begin by introducing the origin of the project idea and the formation of the multi-disciplinary, multi-national team. We then describe the engineering design of the project and the tests performed to verify its functionality. We conclude by discussing the results of the final demonstration of the project and the perceptions of the project’s impact from those involved in its making.",False,No,1.

"Crosscutting Literature on STEAM Ecosystems, Expectancy Value Theory, and Social Emotional Learning: A Metadata Synthesis. Research Report. ETS RR-18-33","In this report, we describe the initial stages of a crosscutting research effort to characterize literature reviewed across 8 different projects--each with objectives aligned toward improving student engagement in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) fields. These projects sought to identify malleable factors (e.g., motivation, persistence) that could potentially be fostered to improve achievement motivation and build participation among historically underrepresented learners in STEAM pathways. Focusing on both the extent to which different broad and facet-level constructs are both discussed and assessed in a diverse pool of literature, we developed a standardized reporting structure and catalogued detailed information on 236 unique references. We found that, as a proportion of the number of times constructs in the STEAM, expectancy value (EV) theory, and social emotional learning (SEL) spaces were discussed in the reviewed literature, they were assessed relatively infrequently. We also found high levels of overlap in the literature across the above 3 focal areas, highlighting both the need to document new assessments designed to support STEAM engagement and an opportunity to use them to evaluate expectancy value theory as a holistic model.",False,No,1.

Determination of Work Humanization in the Epoch of Scientific-Technological Revolution,"The age of steam, railways, electricity, & mechanical technologies has passed quickly in some countries & slowly in others, but is always an irreversible process. We are living now in the era of automation & space flight, in the epoch of electronics & computers. Thus we have entered the period of scientific-technological revolution, marked by passing from mechanical to nonmechanical technologies. Described are five determinants of work humanization, specific for this epoch: (1) passage from direct to indirect work, resulting in gradual liquidation of hard manual labor; (2) intellectualization of production means &, simultaneously, of technological processes, vocational education, & personnel training; (3) the real possibility of shortening the work day & week to a necessary minimum, thus prolonging free time, which can be spent on shaping personality; (4) putting into effect the scientific thesis on the changeability of work, which becomes realistic only in the epoch of qualitatively new change in technology; & (5) demythologization of productive work-a determinant that extends increasingly to the consciousnesses of individuals & whole collectives.

Developing programmable robot for K12 STEAM education,"STEAM is the acronym that is a group of academic disciplines, Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics. In recent years, the STEAM has been considered as the core parts of K12 education system in many countries. Regarding this need, this paper attempts to develop a cheap, interactive and programmable robot to assist K12 students to learn STEAM effectively and friendly. The robot was developed based the open source – Ottobot. Its primary external structure was made by 3D printers, so its shape can be customized by users. In addition, its electrical and electronic devices are compatible to Arduino. The development kits of Arduino are friendly and free, so it is very suitable to new users like K12 and the students with non-engineering background. The control board applied in this study is a low-cost Arduino Nano, which includes 14 digital I/O and 8 analog I/O. Associated with ESP8266 or HC-06, the robot can be controlled remotely via Wifi or Bluetooth. In this paper, we demonstrated the graphical programming tool, called mBlock, to code the firmware of the robot. Its friendly programming interface is similar to the Scratch, which provides K12 students a friendly and useful tool to explore programming world. This paper does not only present the detail information of building a programmable robot, but also demonstrate a friendly tool to assist K12 students to learn the programming ability for developing a smart robot or AI related products.",False,No,1.

Difficulties in implementing STEAM education model at the Northern mountainous preschool in Vietnam,"STEM education – an educational model of 4.0 era, is an educational trend considered an effective educational model recognized by developed countries in the world. However, to apply this model to Vietnam, it is necessary to pay attention to regional factors to choose which education model is appropriate for children, with the actual level of teachers and facilities condition. Localization is a very important thing before implementing a new spear model. In this report, the author wants to mention the difficulties encountered when implementing STEAM education model at preschool in mountainous areas of Northwest Vietnam with the characteristics of mainly ethnic minorities. We conducted a survey of 32 managers and 460 preschool teachers from 3 provinces of Son La, Dien Bien and Lai Chau to explore these difficulties.

Distribution and pollution assessment of heavy metals in surface sediments in Xiaoqing river estuary and its adjacent sea of Laizhou bay,"In this paper, the monitoring results of four heavy metals Cu, Pb, Zn and Hg at 10 sampling stations in Xiaoqing river estuary and its adjacent sea of Laizhou Bay in November 2008 were analyzed and evaluated. The results showed that the concentrations of heavy metals in the steam channel and estuary are higher than those in the adjacent sea, and the metal concentrations were below the standard for I class of marine sediment quality, excepting the station 2 in the steam channel and station 5 in the estuary. The assessment of the single-factor pollution index showed that the overall pollution level of the study area was relatively low, but there was serious pollution phenomenon in individual station. The potential ecological risk of heavy metals in the surface sediments was generally at a low level, and Hg had the highest potential risk.",False,No,1.

"Editorial Board Thoughts: Arts into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics - STEAM, Creative Abrasion, and the Opportunity in Libraries Today","Rather than a continued focus on hyper-specialization and separation, we have the opportunity to rethink the library: exploring novel configurations and services that might better support its community, and embracing emerging roles of trans-disciplinary collaboration and innovation. The Library as Intersection Libraries reflect the institutional and organizational structures of their communities, even as the physical organization of the structures built to house print collections mirror the classification system in use. Specialized almost to the exclusion of other areas of study altogether, in branch libraries of a college or university this division can reach a pinnacle; libraries and collections devoted to exclusive topics of engineering, science, music, and others, exist on campuses across the country. Without active intervention and deliberate effort on the part of the library, opportunities for creative abrasion3 and trans-disciplinary collaboration become virtually non-existent; its potential to ""unleash the creative potential that is latent in a collection of unlike-minded individuals,""4 untapped. ""6 And yet a quick review of the literature reveals that knowledge creation, innovation, and success are inextricably linked7, with the fundamental understanding of their connection having undergone a dramatic shift: ""knowledge is in fact essential to innovate, and while this might sound obvious today, putting knowledge and innovation and not physical assets at the centre of competitive advantage was a tremendous change.

Effect of Heat Curing Method on the Mechanical Strength of Alkali-Activated Slag Mortar after High-Temperature Exposure,"The aim of this work was to study the mechanical strength and microstructure changes of alkali-activated slag mortar (AAS mortar) after being heat treated in the temperature range of 200–1000 °C. The AAS mortar was cured in the ambient condition (20 ± 5 °C, 60 ± 5% RH) (Relative humidity: RH) and high temperature condition (80 °C) for 27 days with three different heating regimes: curing in a dry oven, curing in sealed plastic bags, and in a steam environment. The activator for the AAS synthesis was a mixture of sodium silicate solution (water glass) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with a SiO 2 /Na 2 O weight ratio of 1, and a dosage of 4% Na 2 O by slag weight. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) incorporated with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were used to assess the mortar microstructure change. The results revealed that the curing method significantly affected the mechanical strength of AAS at temperatures lower than 800 °C. The heat treatment at late age of 28 days was more beneficial for compressive strength enhancement in specimens without using heat curing methods.",False,No,1.

Effect of thermotherapy on the acquisition of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus by the Asian citrus psyllid (Hemiptera: Liviidae),"The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae), is the most detrimental insect pest of citrus crops due to its role as a vector of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), the bacterial causal agent of huanglongbing, also known as citrus greening disease. Trees infected with Las decline rapidly and fruit production decreases until eventual tree death. Few treatment options for infected trees are available for disease management. A technique called ""thermotherapy"" is under development to reduce bacterial titers in infected trees; however, the effect of these treatments on the transmission cycle of Las is not known. Field and laboratory assays were conducted to determine whether thermotherapy treatment reduced Las acquisition by D. citri. Trees in the field were treated with a mobile heat treatment system. Potted trees in the laboratory were treated in a steam chamber. We monitored acquisition rates in D. citri following thermal treatment of Las-positive Citrus sinensis (L.) (Rutaceae). Psyllid acquisition and Las titer in thermotherapy-treated trees were compared with untreated Las-positive and untreated Las-negative trees. Our results confirmed the efficacy of whole-tree thermotherapy on Las in potted citrus trees. In contrast, thermotherapy did not significantly reduce plant Las titers or acquisition of Las by D. citri under field conditions. These results suggest that further development of field application methods is needed to determine the utility of thermotherapy as a tool for huanglongbing management.",False,No,1.

Effectiveness of Maltodextrin as a Coating in Microencapsulation of Clove Leaves Oil (<i>Syzygium aromaticum</i>) for Antibacterial Applications,"Clove leaves oil is potential oil used as antibacterial such as Escherichia coli . However, clove leaves oil has several disadvantages, including being easily oxidized and volatile. In order to overcome this problem a microencapsulation process is carried out. The purpose of this study was to test the ability of clove leaves oil and the results of microencapsulation as an antibacterial E. coli. Clove leaves oil was isolated using water-steam distillation. Furthermore, the obtained essential oil was microcapsulated by spray-drying method. Microencapsulation results were characterized using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) to determine the morphology of the produced material. The SEM results indicate that the resulting microcapsules are rounded shape, which shows that the formed microcapsules have not fully developed. The results of the activity test by using clove leaves oil as an antibacterial E. coli denoted a inhibitory zone diameter was 15.2 mm, while the oil was microencapsulated with a coating ratio of 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10, 1:12 produces inhibitory zones 9.9; 11.3; 12.9; 14.8 and 17.5 mm, respectively. Results of statistical tests indicate that antibacterial activity of clove leaves oil is 100 % significantly different from the comparative microencapsulation activity 1:4 with t value = 11.30&gt;t tab = 9.93. Ratio microcapsul 1:6; 1:8; 1:10 and 1:12 having activities that were no different from clove leaves oil 100% and were showed by t value 8.65; 4.25; 0.76; 2.62, respectively &lt; t tab = 9.93 on the confidence level α = 0,01; df =2.

Enhancing elementary school prevention program implementation through influential contextual factors,"A current gap in the literature exists with regard to formulating a holistic view of contextual factors involved in school-based prevention programming implementation. The purpose of this grounded theory study is to further explore how multilevel ecological and cross-system factors influence prevention program implementation. This study builds on development of a theory to guide the practices for preventive program implementation with fidelity. The Integrated Program (IP) conceptual framework, initiated in an earlier paper (Schmidt Hanbidge, 2009) identified key program contextual and motivational factors that critically influence prevention program implementation. Taken from an ecological perspective, the IP framework incorporates multi-levels of systems from the individual, to organization, to the community contexts. Twenty-four interviews were conducted in two stages with school program facilitators, school principals, and program administrators delivering a prevention program, STEAM (Skills & Tools for Emotion Awareness and Management) in elementary schools in southern Ontario, Canada. Theoretical sampling was utilized and data was analyzed and coded, aided by the program, QSR Nvivo. Grounded theory was the research methodology used in this study to refine the IP conceptual framework for implementation of school-based emotion regulation programs. The study determined several contextual and motivational factors that facilitated program implementation, such as: open communication/support from key stakeholders, adequate program resources (including time and space), knowledgeable, experienced training and skilled supervision for program facilitators. The study identified how several contextual factors were considered to be barriers to the implementation process and could threaten the fidelity of the program. The study adds to the prevention literature by identifying how the program facilitators progress through an evolutionary process as they become more experienced. They typically start out as program facilitators, thereafter becoming role models, then mentors, then finally experts. This study identifies ways to integrate the specific contextual and motivational factors in the implementation process of the school-based prevention programs. The IP framework was refined, based on the study data, to recognize the effect of ""differentiated"" program delivery. During implementation, study participants identified and adapted the prevention program to ""fit"" the specific school environment which aided in the sustainability of their program.

Examining the Experiences of First-Year Honors Engineering Students in Service-Learning,"While research-projects and skill-based courses are critical in engineering and computer science curricula, service-learning has been highlighted as a worthwhile experience for all students. Specifically, this pedagogy has been shown to be beneficial in helping students from underrepresented groups who typically lack opportunities to gain technical experience prior to embarking on higher education garner experience in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM). This research study explores the experiences of a small group of Introduction to Engineering Honors students during Fall 2016 and Fall 2017. Working in teams within their respective classes, both sets of students were required to design and execute a service-learning project aimed at teaching middle-school aged children about STEAM. This mandatory project entailed creating a presentation and preparing a hands-on activity to be presented at an afterschool program at a local center for adolescents. The goals of this service-learning experience for both parties were mutual. Through their participation, the Honors engineering and computer science students gained experience in strategic teamwork and effective communication with a non-technical audience and developed a clear self-concept regarding their motivations and goals in pursuing engineering or computer science. Simultaneously, the middle-school aged teenagers at the center for adolescents gained exposure to the work of engineers and computer scientists and a glimpse into the life of a college student, meeting the surrounding low income, low access community’s need to increase students’ interest in STEAM fields and motivation to pursue higher education. Upon completing their service-learning presentation, each engineering student will be administered a survey calling them to reflect on their experience and how relevant they feel it is to their formation and goals as engineers and computer scientists. One key point to note is that the primary researcher was one of the college students surveyed in the first group of participants. Students in the second group of participants will also be given the opportunity to participate in a focus group, where they will be encouraged to think deeper about their experience working with the local adolescents, their aspirations in engineering or computer science, and the key points they took away from the project that are applicable to their professional careers. All students’ responses will be analyzed with special interest paid to how students’ experiences differed based on their gender, past engineering or computer science experiences, and future goals. It is important to note that this study is a work-in-progress.",False,No,1.

Exploring the effectiveness of STEAM design processes on middle school students’ creativity,"Creativity has an important role in many scientific processes which constitute a large and complex structure. It is difficult to identify and measure. Students’ creativity can be enhanced through specific education programs. The aim of this study was to develop a science, technology, engineering, art, mathematics (STEAM) design process program for teaching 7th grade middle school students to enhance their verbal and figural creativity. The study lasted 11&#xa0;weeks. Pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental method with a nonequivalent control group was used. Study Group (n = 34) was presented a teaching approach focused on STEAM education, while the control group (n = 34) was taught based on the science curriculum and science textbook. Nine different STEAM design activities were developed. The data were collected with the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking. The SPSS Program was used in analyzing the data. At the end of the study, significant differences were determined in favor of the study group in both verbal and figural creativity. As a result of the study, recommendations for implementation of STEAM design processes were discussed.",False,No,1.

Geothermal Energy: Resource and Utilization. A Teaching Module,"The search for new energy resources as alternatives to fossil fuels have generated new interest in the heat of the earth itself. New geothermal areas with a variety of characteristics are being explored, as are new ways of extracting work from naturally heated steam and hot water. Some of this effort is discussed in this three-part module. Five types of geothermal resources and their development and utilization are reviewed in the first section. Geothermal energy and related principles are discussed in the second section. These include: force, work, energy, power; absolute temperature and pressure; heat engines, carnot engine; enthalpy; and availability and maximum work. Geothermal energy utilization is discussed in the third section, focusing on electricity generated from and non-electrical applications of geothermal energy. Also included in the module are study questions (with answers), a list of references, and, in appendices, measurement tables and tables of properties of saturated steam and saturated water (temperature, pressure) and properties of superheated steam and compressed water (temperature and pressure). The module contains the equivalent of 1-week's material and is suitable for use in introductory college physics courses and in advanced high school physics programs. (JN)",False,No,1.

Getting to 2014: The Choices and Challenges Ahead,"Over the next few years, educators and policymakers have committed to implementing an array of challenging, but potentially transformative, reforms--reforms that could go beyond rearranging furniture to fundamentally restructuring and improving teaching and learning. Facing this much simultaneous change would be difficult even without the possibility that some of these changes may be in conflict--a proverbial iceberg in the path of reform. Collisions are more likely to happen when policymakers and educators plow full steam ahead, failing to look across the spectrum of reform and consider how each change affects the others. Thus, those overseeing these efforts must consider how multiple changes look when implemented together at the same time. If they don't, collisions could sink the opportunity to get school reform right. But if they do, they can anticipate challenges, make smart policy choices, and navigate the trade-offs that naturally follow. In this collection of essays, contributors discuss five of these dilemmas: (1) How do we successfully implement new accountability systems and interventions during the transition to new standards and assessments?; (2) How do we maintain the rigor of college- and career-ready standards without pushing more students out of the system?; (3) How do we adopt fair teacher evaluation systems based on student assessments when those assessments are set to change?; (4) How do we move toward more standardization while also promoting innovation?; and (5) How can we execute multiple, complex reforms in a time of limited resources? These are true dilemmas, without right-or-wrong answers. Thus, it is hoped that these essays provide a forum for provocative ideas: ideas that may not be particularly comfortable or comforting, but are nonetheless worthy of debate as policymakers, practitioners, and educators begin to tackle these challenges. Essays included in this volume are: (1) Getting Accountability and Implementation Right (Michael Cohen); (2) Doing It All: Raising Graduation Rates and Standards (Robert Balfanz); (3) Taking the Long-Term View on Teacher Evaluation (Bill Tucker); (4) Leaping Forward Without Holding Schools Back (Bryan C. Hassel and Emily Ayscue Hassel); and (5) Getting Results With Limited Resources (Allan Odden). Individual essays contain notes.

Heat transfer in coiled type superheater of moisture separator-reheater of turbines at the nuclear power plant,The reheating part of the moisture separator-reheater (MSR) of nuclear power plant (NPP) steam turbine occupies a significant part of MSR volume and requires large consumption of metal. The superheating of low pressure steam provides by the high pressure steam condensation. This steam supplies partly from turbine inlet and partly from turbine stage bleeding because of two superheater stages. The significantly less heat transfer intensity at the single-phase side of reheater comparatively with condensation side requires intensification of heat transfer from the heated-steam. For such goal the different methods can be used: for instance the cross flow of the coiled tubes and finning of straight tubes bundles. Also is perspective the usage of artificial roughness in form of small “moons” and other types of artificial roughnesses.,False,No,1.

Influence of different ratio of CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> and foaming additives on supercritical foaming of expanded thermoplastic polyurethane,"Expanded thermoplastic polyurethane (ETPU) foam materials with superelasticity for footwear application were developed and investigated. ETPU foams with different ratios of CO 2 /N 2 as foaming agents and ETPU foams prepared by pure nitrogen foaming with different kinds of foaming additives were prepared by supercritical (Sc) foaming technology, which further made into sheet forms through the steam molding process. TPU foam exhibits better cell structure, crystallization performance, and mechanical strength with the increased CO 2 proportion. Further, the foams using 25% CO 2 -75% N 2 and 50% CO 2 -50% N 2 , showed a lower density and excellent resilience and cyclic-compression performance. However, an increase of N 2 ratio improves the dimensional stability and compression set of the foam. The introduction of foaming aids enhances the interaction between Sc-N 2 and TPU.

"Innovating Industrial Design Curriculum in a Knowledge-Based, Participatory and Digital Era","This article discusses three years' research (2012-2014) on design education towards a 2016 undergraduate industrial design curriculum launch. It contributes a pathway for conservative courses towards design culture transformation and filling gaps between them and leading breakthrough education exemplars. The course proposes a collective knowledge creation model through social constructivism and constructionism that recognises its place in time and history and allows customisation to individual upbringing. It catches up with a profession transformed beyond a digital Bauhaus manifesto that joined and revaluated physical and digital artefacts as per their environment, quality of experiences, intelligence, networks and relations. Data and findings supported pedagogy redefinition from master-apprentice and teacher-centred skill transmission models to heutagogy and paragogy. The new approach required habitus change from a traditional goods-centred discipline to human-centred focus, critical design and making, design heuristics, CDIO (conceiving, designing, implementing, operating) and STEAM (science, technology, arts, mathematics) frameworks. Participants empathetically contextualised, problem framed and solved by crossing boundaries between disciplines, institutions, industries, students' background and society. Research and practice promoted new forms of industrial design creation happening in physical and digital coexisting spaces of being. Course units evolved around an e-curriculum component working as a digital spine. Curriculum progressed from standard top-down transmission to sociotechnical and organisational networking, industry collaboration, international design studio and Design Factory model-like projects. In doing so, it became a foundation for future physical-digital industrial design artefacts, human computer interaction, machine learning, hacker culture systems, shared information, free open-source software and hardware development within a 4.0 industrial revolution.",False,No,1.

Integrating Arts with STEM to Foster Systems Thinking,"Interest is growing among out-of-school time (OST) educators in integrating the arts into STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) programming (e.g., Kelton &amp; Saraniero, 2018). Arts-integrated STEM--or STEAM--programming now takes place in a wide variety of OST environments, from relatively institutional learning settings, such as a library, to emergent or fluid settings, such as a pop-up program in a housing development community room. Educators often consider OST environments to be conducive to creative and conceptually ambitious STEAM programming because these spaces have the potential to deconstruct rigid boundaries between disciplines that formal education often reinforces. In this article, the authors discuss an OST STEAM program titled Zoom! that they designed and implemented in a summer camp in July 2019. Zoom! used visual arts strategies to support elementary-aged children in thinking about and communicating systems-level ideas related to the human microbiome--the community of single-celled organisms that live on and inside the human body.",False,No,1.

Introduction of the integrative STEAM approach as a learning innovation in the COVID-19 pandemic in South Kalimantan,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced all communities to have technological knowledge, particularly in the education sector. This study aimed to introduce the integrative STEAM approach as a learning innovation in the COVID-19 pandemic for schools in South Kalimantan, Indonesia. The implementation of the 2013 thematic integrative curriculum in elementary schools is a unique challenge for parents in guiding their children. One of the suitable approaches following this demand is integrative STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics). This approach is able to perform creative and innovative learning by utilizing integrated technology in accordance with the 2013 Curriculum in elementary schools. The total of 120 correspondents participated in the service activities aimed to introduce this approach, and it consisted of Elementary School teachers and its students’ aide in the South Kalimantan. This introductory activity began with the presentation of the approach, followed by a discussion session as well as questions and answers, which ends with an evaluation of its implementation by filling a questionnaire. The results showed that 93.75% of the participants were interested in the presented topics since they aroused their curiosity. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is an increase in insight and knowledge about the integrative STEAM approach to the participants.",False,No,1.

IoT with a Soft Touch: A Modular Remote Sensing Platform for STE(A)M Applications,"Besides wide attraction in the industry, IoT is being used to advance STEM and STEAM education across a range of education levels. This work presents a remote sensing platform, named IoT with a Soft Touch, developed to achieve two goals. First, it aims to lower the technicality, stimulating the students to do STE(A)M. Second, the technology is to be used in `softer' applications (e.g., environmental and health care), thereby aiming to attract a more diverse set of student profiles. Students can easily build a wireless sensing device, with a specific application in mind. The modular design of the platform and an intuitive graphical configurator tool allows them to tailor the device's functionality to their needs. The sensor's data is transmitted wirelessly with LoRaWAN. The data can be viewed and analyzed on a dashboard, or the raw data can be extracted for further processing, e.g., as part of the school's STE(A)M curriculum.

K-12 Bolsters Ties to Engineering,"When science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education is discussed in the K-12 sphere, it often seems like shorthand for mathematics and science, with perhaps a nod to technology and even less, if any, real attention to engineering. But recent developments signal that the ""e"" in STEM may be gaining a firmer foothold at the precollegiate level. For one, a new, national assessment in technology and engineering literacy will be administered to 8th graders next year by the makers of ""the nation's report card"" on education. Also, engineering design is threaded through a set of ""next generation"" science standards nearing completion by a coalition of experts and 26 states.

MAKER: Come to the Dark Side—We Have Cookies: Creating an Interactive Display to Engage Everyone in STEAM,"In a not so distant place, in a galaxy much similar to our own we find ourselves delving into the “dark side” of things to engage students. Find out how a somewhat non-traditional approach to student and community engagement has lead to huge interest in the STEAM fields at [name removed]. This maker demonstration will showcase how utilizing a theme such as Star Wars creates a framework for student exploration into the maker field. We will present multiple maker components created by students to work both independently and to become part of a larger interactive display focused around a common theme. Each maker piece will have accompanying instructions on how to design and build it; as well as we will be providing the larger framework guidelines to be able to replicate such an interactive display in a variety of academic programs (K-12 to college). This approach allows for students’ personalized learning on their own maker project while bringing into view the bigger picture of the needs for design specifications and the utilization of skills outside their traditional areas of study. The maker components include Arduinos, LEDs, stepper motors, 3D printed objects, etc. Thus begins a new hope for STEAM. It is a period of academic unrest as we venture to the dark side and bring about a period of personalized engagement.

Math Learning in a Science Museum—Proposal for a Workshop Design Based on STEAM Strategy to Learn Mathematics. The Case of the Cryptography Workshop,"In mathematics teaching, great efforts are made, and diverse teaching strategies are employed in order to facilitate students’ learning process. Informal environments have proven to be conducive and motivating spaces for science learning. In particular, science museums can be used as a complement and collaborate in order to leverage each of their strengths to motivate mathematics learning. Educational models give a global explanation to the learning process. Taking into account all these aspects and considering van Hiele’s model as didactic reference, we propose the design of a general workshop that has among its objectives the learning of mathematics. To do this, we start from the three main elements and processes set forth in van Hiele’s model: insight, reasoning levels and learning phases. The insight or student’s competence are formulated through Hoffer’s abilities, and for the development of the activities of the learning phases, the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and maths) strategy. Once the general proposal has been made, we use it to design a scientific workshop for learning mathematics about cryptography. Our greatest challenge was in generating activities adapted to the established requirements. It would be interesting, for future works, to design research to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposal presented. Moreover, it would be interesting to develop a proposal for assessing student learning.",False,No,1.

Modeling Geyser Eruptions in the Classroom,"Watching Old Faithful transform from a smoldering mound to an explosive 50-meter high geyser is enough to generate awe in any observer. Behind this stunning, visual geologic display is a triad of heat, water, and plumbing that rarely unify on our planet. But geologists are not the only scientists drawn to geysers. Biologists have recently recognized thermal features as a habitat of interesting bacteria that thrive in extreme conditions and may provide clues to the origin of life. Engineers tap into the steam and hot water found in thermal areas around the Pacific Rim to generate electricity without releasing the carbon dioxide associated with fossil fuels. Geysers provide an excellent opportunity to explore the Earth system as described by the National Science Education Standards (content standard D for grades 5?8). By using the geyser model activity described in this article, students can investigate the relationship between the hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere. In addition, students will be able to develop descriptions, explanations, and predictions using the model as a guide for their exploration and apply their thinking to their local setting.

Music Notes to Amino Acid Sequence: A STEAM Approach to Study Protein Structure,"Recently, manuscripts that use bioinformatics tools to convert proteins and other biological materials into music have appeared in several journals. The authors claim that this type of studies adds joy to education of life sciences and attract public attention to biochemistry education along with other uses. We thought the reverse of the process might also be possible for the purpose. We converted notes into amino acids depending on the decreasing hydrophobicity and by using the famous nursery song ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" notes, a hypothetical protein sequence was obtained. Three-dimensional structures were modeled by I-Tasser Protein Structure and Function Prediction server and the structure of the possible models were investigated.

National Standards Gain Steam: Governors' Embrace Rooted in Competitiveness Concerns,"This article reports that the National standards--once the untouchable ""third rail"" of American education policy--now have the backing of the nation's governors, a growing number of education leaders, and the U.S. secretary of education. The National Governors Association last week adopted a policy statement endorsing a process to develop common academic standards by comparing student performance on international tests. The governors join several education groups--the Council of the Great City Schools, the National Association of Secondary School Principals, and the American Federation of Teachers among them--in endorsing the idea that the nation should set a common definition of what students should know and be able to do.",False,No,1.

New Models and Metaphors for Human Resource Development,"This document contains two reports from a poster session on new ideas and models in human resource development (HRD). The first presentation, ""Two-way Customer-Service Provider Cycle"" (Harriet V. Lawrence, Albert K. Wiswell), discusses a two-way supply cycle model that illustrates relational issues in customer service, including needs and wants, expectations, quality, timeliness, cost, requirements, discrepancies, and feedback. The second paper describes a session titled ""Using Art to Explore a Metaphor for the Training Process"" (Darren Short), in which the poster offered the visual metaphor of the transition of ice to water to steam for the potential effects of the training process on individuals. Conference attendees were invited to interpret the metaphor in light of their own human resource development experiences with employee training. (KC)",False,No,1.

Normalizing Black Students/Youth and Their Families' Digital and STEAM Literacies,"Due to the paucity of research that focuses on the digital and STEAM literacy practices of Black students and youth and their families in home and community spaces, this article acts as a call for awareness to understand the already-existing digital practices that acknowledges and honors their racial, cultural, and social lives. Lewis Ellison addresses four primary questions that K-12 teachers must be aware of concerning Black parents, students and youth in digital and STEM spaces: Why are Black Students'/Youth and Families' Digital Literacy Practices important? What can we learn from Black Parents' Narratives about their Children's Digital and STEAM Literacies? What do Black Students/Youth Wish their Teachers Knew about Them? What Should Digital and STEM Literacy Practices Look Like for Black Students/Youth? These questions are important when thinking about Black students' and youth's digital literacy learning and proficiencies because as the education and political world keeps changing, they need digital literacy skills for every area of their lives. Once we understand the roles we play in centering their lives and practices, then we can advance teacher education, and then we can begin a discussion to normalize Black students and their families' digital and STEAM literacies and practices.",False,No,1.

On the Role of Engineering in Mathematical Development,"It is customary for engineering syllabuses to include a substantial amount of mathematics, a fact traditionally justified through their usefulness in the analysis and resolution of many technological problems. In other words, usually the role of mathematics in engineering is emphasized. Nevertheless, the opposite viewpoint could be considered as well: What, if any, is the role of engineering in mathematics? This is a less popular standpoint, and we shall show in this paper that there exist engineering ancestors in some very pure mathematics, and that interrelation is a constant between technological and scientific areas. In particular, we track the ancestors of fractal geometry and chaos up to the development of steam technologies in the 18th century. (Contains 5 figures and 1 table.)",False,No,1.

Optimizing the preparation of Ni‐Ce‐Pr catalysts for efficient hydrogen production by n‐dodecane steam reforming,"Nowadays, the development of fuel cell is getting more and more inseparable from the production of hydrogen. Long‐chain hydrocarbons steam reforming is a feasible way for hydrogen supply. Herein, various nickel‐ceria‐praseodymium (Ni‐Ce‐Pr) catalysts have been prepared by a sol‐gel method. Multiple parameters during catalyst preparation, including the amount of Ni, the content of doped Pr and the calcination temperature, were systematically studied for tuning the catalytic performance for n ‐dodecane steam reforming in a fixed‐bed reactor under 15 mL/g cat ·h at 600°C and water‐to‐carbon molar ratio of 2 at 0.1 MPa. Reaction data showed that both the amount of Ni and the content of doped Pr will greatly affect the n ‐dodecane conversion and hydrogen production. Additionally, the calcination temperature during catalyst preparation showed a big influence on its performance for n ‐dodecane steam reforming. After optimization, 10Ni‐CePr 2 ‐600 exhibits the highest activity and stability for n ‐dodecane steam reforming, accompanying with the lowest rate of coke deposition (0.015 g c /g cat ·h). The structure and oxygen vacancy of the catalyst was characterized by H 2 ‐TPR, Raman, and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

Pencil‐traced‐graphite on cellulose: A rapid and solvent‐less approach for solar steam generation,"Solar steam generation has proven to be a sustainable method to handle water shortage. Various materials for solar steam generation have been introduced in the past few years. However, the utilization of tedious and complicated synthesis to generate a photoactive layer is a matter of concern in the fabrication solar steam generation devices. Thus, improved methods toward cost‐effectiveness by exploring economical materials with simple manufacturing process are urgently and essentially needed. In this study, we first report on manufacturing hybrid membranes using commercially accessible materials, that is, cellulose paper and pencil graphite. The proposed method is to trace and coat a cellulose paper directly with a pencil without the use of solvents and chemicals, and it is possible to create an ecofriendly photoactive layer without a complicated process. The formed pencil graphite‐traced membranes were successfully utilized in solar steam generation and showed excellent steam generation rate of 4.32 kg/m 2 h which is almost 3.5 times more than that of pristine membrane at solar intensity of 3 Sun. The developed method could be widely utilized in the field of solar steam generation, since it is very facile and simple, and can be integrated to other commonly used materials for solar steam generation such as fabric and wood. In addition, on‐site production is possible, so it has a potential to be utilized in remote and resource‐limited areas for steam generation.",False,No,1.

"Physical Education as a Subject in France (School Curriculum, Policies and Discourse): The Body and the Metaphors of the Engine -- Elements Used in the Analysis of a Power and Control System during the Second Industrial Revolution","An analysis of several works by people who contributed greatly to the development of physical education in France from the middle of the 19th century to the 1960s enables us to pinpoint the rules underlying the specialized language used in this field & the metaphorical & mythological systems that were set up as systems of control over the body. Among these images, it is particularly interesting to examine how ""man"" came to be seen in terms of a steam engine, then as a machine, & even more generally as a humanized form of ""productivity."". 86 References.

"Playing, Debugging, Learning: A Proposal between Game and Instructional Designs via Extended Prototyping","This article investigates the phenomenon of open and participative development (e.g. beta testing, Kickstarter projects)--i.e. extended prototyping--in digital entertainment as a potential source of insights for instructional interventions. Despite the increasing popularity of this practice and the potential implications for educators and instructional designers, little efforts have been done in enlightening the topic. This study aims to address this lack by staging a bridge between Instructional Design and Game Design with an empirical inquiry. N:130 subjects (beta testers and Steam Early Access and Kickstarter users) were recruited with a quantitative questionnaire about their contribution to open development instances. Behavioral patterns, effective policies and managements, and subjective profiles and opinions were gathered and tied to instructional design models and concepts. Results point to successful techniques in designing and applying such a process, while mistakes and unproductive tactics are highlighted as well. To summarize, instruction can take advantage of an increased participation of targeted audiences/learners to its development phases. Benefits span transparency, engagement, and commitment. However, poor communication and incoherence between testing and final product may weaken the overall outcome.",False,No,1.

Relational Epistemologies in Land-Based Learning Environments: Reasoning about Ecological Systems and Spatial Indexing in Motion,"Social and cultural practices in learning settings are sites for leveraging and/or remediating sustainable and just conceptions of nature-culture relations to meet changing environmental demands of twenty-first century. In this study,&#xa0;we examine epistemic navigation among Indigenous youth in an outdoor, land based, STEAM (science, education, arts, math, and science) camp which not only leveraged nature-culture relations as part of critical engagement with socio-ecological systems, but also as a site for Indigenous resurgence and well-being in learning spaces. We&#xa0;take a microethnographic (Gee and Green in Rev Res Educ 23:119-169, 1998. https://doi.org/10.2307/1167289) approach&#xa0;to examine sense-making among three youth while engaged in a walking activity in which they were asked to embody a plant as part of cultural practices of reading the land.

Restoring a Classic Electric Car,"One hundred years ago, automobiles were powered by steam, electricity, or internal combustion.

Reviving the William Liddell Damask Design Collection,"The William Liddell archive is a collection of over 1600 glass photographic plates recovered from the premises of the abandoned Ewart-Liddell weaving factory in Donaghcloney, County Down, Northern Ireland. The salvaged collection was donated to the Belfast School of Art in 2007; however, the condition was so fragile that they have not been able to be accessed or used. Heritage Lottery Funding was secured in 2017 to make this unique archive accessible to the public and to support a series of local road shows culminating in an exhibition in Autumn 2018 in the Linen Centre, Lisburn Museum. This paper reports on preliminary findings after the careful digitization and cataloguing of each plate. The plates appear to have been kept as a record of the working methods of designers and technical draughtsmen and draughtswomen in the company dating from the early twentieth century to 1970s. The sketches, designs, and technical drawings recorded were used for the production of Jacquard Damask linen for tableware, bed linen and furnishings. The collection evidences a tantalizing clientele that was worldwide. William Liddell produced high quality Damask linen products for clients across the globe, top hotels such as the Hilton, Savoy, Raffles and the Ritz; shipping lines such as Cunard, White Star, and the Union Steam Navigation Company of New Zealand; organizations such as the U.S. Navy, the Bohemian Club San Francisco, Canadian Coastguards and Claridges. The photographs document design specifications from Liddell's clients, early sketches, painted drawings, accurately hand-drafted designs and typography, point paper layouts, and proof cloths. It is extraordinary that this form of unique photographic record was kept and perhaps more astonishing that the observation of everyday affairs of a textile manufacturing design office were the subjects of such an extensive and persistent documentary endeavor.

Risk Information for Public Consumption: Print Media Coverage of Two Risky Situations,"An examination of the extent to which: (1) newspaper & magazine coverage of two risky situations included the kinds of cognitive information that would help readers make risk judgments; & (2) the scientific sophistication of the audience would influence such inclusion. The two situations were a nuclear power plant accident near Rochester, NY, that released a small amount of radioactive steam into the atmosphere, & a report in the 12 Mar 1981 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine (MacMahon, B., et al, ""Coffee and Cancer of the Pancreas,"" 304, 630-633) about a potential relationship between coffee consumption & pancreatic cancer. Stories about each topic (N = 100 & 45, respectively) appearing in trade, popular science, & general magazines, & in both prestige & more typical daily newspapers, were examined to determine the nature & extent of risk information included.

Simulation and Evaluation of Heat Transfer Inside a Diseased Citrus Tree during Heat Treatment,"Heat treatment has been applied in previous studies to treat diseased plants and trees affected by heat-sensitive pathogens. Huanglongbing (HLB) is a heat-sensitive pathogen and the optimal temperature–time for treating HLB-affected citrus trees was estimated to be 54 °C for 60 to 120 s from indoor experimental studies. However, utilizing this method in orchards is difficult due to technical difficulties to effectively apply heat. Recently, a mobile thermotherapy system (MTS) was developed to in-field treat HLB-affected trees. This mobile device includes a canopy cover that covers the diseased tree and a system to supply steam under the cover to treat the tree. It was proven that the temperature inside the canopy cover can reach the desired one (i.e., 54 °C) to kill bacteria. However, for HLB, the heat should penetrate the tree’s phloem where the bacteria live. Therefore, measuring the heat penetration inside the tree is very critical to evaluate the performance of the MTS. In this study, a heat transfer model was developed to simulate the heat penetration inside the tree and predict the temperature in the phloem of the diseased tree during the in-field heat treatment. The simulation results were compared with in-field experimental measurements. The heat transfer model was developed by a comparative analysis of the experimental data using the ANSYS software. Results showed that the temperature in the phloem was 10–40% lower than the temperature near the surface of the bark. Simulation results were consistent with experimental results, with an average relative error of less than 5%.",False,No,1.

Softly As I Leave You,"The third of Lokuge's novels after If the Moon Smiled (2000) and Turtle Nest (2003), not including a collection of short fiction, Moth and Other Stories (1992), Softly as I Leave You begins on a slow turgid note as it delineates an unlikable female protagonist, the remarkably self-absorbed Uma presented as a stereotypical exotic beauty with honey skin, lush raven hair and sparkling, come hither eyes that can go from being drenched in love, to being distant and disengaged. [...]despite the clichéd character descriptions that threaten to asphyxiate the narrative at first, the novel gathers steam and tells a compelling story of love, betrayal, and loss as Uma and her devoted husband, Chris, himself a first generation Australian of Italian origins, are forced to confront the loss of their son, Arjun, and find a way to re-connect after long years of a slowly unraveling marriage. [...]Uma's adulterous affair with Liam and her extreme neediness becomes the altar at which the happiness of her family is sacrificed as Arjun, and then Chris, discover this illicit relationship and are shattered.",False,No,2.

STEAM as an Innovative Educational Technology,"The purpose of this work is to develop a model for the construction of STEAM-education, which is based on project training in the so-called ""creative spaces"". ""Creative spaces"" are integration areas of schoolchildren, students and graduate students working in the format of joint work on projects initiated by various structures of a society and business. The authors of the article analyzed the experience of different countries in the implementation of STEM and STEAM-education and identified the effective ways of structuring technical disciplines, art and creative activity into a single integration program. During 2017-2018 years within the framework of informal and nonformal education, an experimental work was carried out with 32 schoolchildren and 34 students, aimed at determining the level of the development of such competences as: the ability to manage projects and processes, system thinking, the ability to art creativity, the ability to work within the teams, groups and individuals, the ability to work in a regime of high uncertainty and a rapid change in the conditions of tasks. Analysis of the results of experimental work has shown that the use of ""creative spaces"" for the implementation of project activities of schoolchildren and students, the inclusion of the category ""art"" in its content allows students to form skills and competencies necessary for the Industry 4.0.",False,No,1.

STEM and the Arts and Humanities: Debunking a False Dichotomy,"The false dichotomy that suggests schools must choose between STEM (or STEAM) and the humanities would not merit the time it takes to write an article if not for a dangerous crescendo of backlash clouding the senses of boards and administrations around the independent school world.

Taipei American School is a K-12 American independent school located in a vibrant international capital city.

Study on the reaction performance of Ce‐doped NiFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> oxygen carriers in the process of chemical looping hydrogen production,"Chemical looping hydrogen production is a kind of hydrogen production technology with great potential. NiFe 2 O 4 is one of the oxygen carriers with the best comprehensive hydrogen production performance, but the oxygen carrier still has the disadvantages of low hydrogen production and poor reaction stability. In this paper, a small amount of Ce was doped in the oxygen carrier to improve the hydrogen production efficiency. And the reaction stability of the oxygen carrier was improved by loading an inert carrier. The experimental results showed that the 6 wt% Ce‐NiFe 2 O 4 oxygen carrier had the highest H 2 yield, and the hydrogen yield per unit mass of oxygen carrier was increased from 194 to 367 mL/g. Thermodynamic simulation and characterization results showed that the doping of Ce could enhance the oxygen release capacity and hydrogen production capacity. In the cyclic experiment, due to the damage of the oxygen carrier spinel structure and the sintering of oxygen carrier particles, the reaction activity of the 6 wt% Ce‐NiFe 2 O 4 oxygen carrier gradually reduced and the hydrogen production in the steam reactor decreased significantly after 15 cycles. After the loading of Al 2 O 3 inert support on the 6 wt% Ce‐NiFe 2 O 4 oxygen carrier, the hydrogen production was greatly improved and remained stable after 15 cycles. The modification of the oxygen carrier could not only increase the hydrogen production but also the economic efficiency for the reduced amount of Ce and Ni.",False,No,1.

Study on the Selection of Single-Screw Steam Compressors in Industrial Steam Supply,"Both direct and indirect heating compression methods were proposed to satisfy the requirement of industrial steam compression and supply. The compression process in a single-screw compressor was analyzed with the determination of different inlet and outlet boundary conditions. Considering the misalignment of meshing pairs caused by the offset of the star wheel axis and screw origin, the differential expansion of the vertical meshing pair was further analyzed. The inner ring of the sealing end face, the wall of the inner ring of the bearing at the inlet and outlet ends, and the bottom surface of the bracket were analyzed by different coordinate systems and different constraints, thus facilitating the design and selection of the single screw. The critical point for the design of a steam-type single-screw compressor is an outlet temperature of 350 °C and an outlet volume flow rate of 130 m 3 /min. At a flow rate of 130 m 3 /min, when the temperature exceeds 350 °C, the reliability of the compressor is still limited, and the differential expansion of the meshing pair exceeds 0.3 mm. In addition, superheating of steam can be improved by applying a centrifugal compressor with cascade compression and centrifugal compression in conjunction with reflux adjustment at the compression outlet.",False,No,1.

The Accountability Plateau,"With the tenth anniversary of No Child Left Behind (NCLB) fast approaching, that law's legacy continues to be fiercely contested. This new analysis of National Assessment of Educational Progress scores--focusing on Texas and on the entire nation--by former National Center for Education Statistics commissioner Mark Schneider finds that solid gains in math achievement coincided with the advent of ""consequential accountability,"" first in the trailblazing Lone Star State and a few other pioneer states, then across the land with the implementation of NCLB. But Schneider warns that the recent plateau in Texas math scores may foreshadow a coming stagnation in the country's performance. Has the testing-and-accountability movement as we know it run out of steam? How else might we rekindle our nation's education progress? (Contains 12 figures and 8 footnotes.) [Foreword by Chester E.

The analysis of the development of the 5E-STEAM learning model to improve critical thinking skills in natural science lesson,"This article aims to develop 5E-STEAM learning model that is used to increase the critical thinking skill in science learning. Critical thinking is the ability to think logically, to apply these rational thoughts in order to evaluate problems, and to make good judgments and decisions. 5E-STEAM is a learning model that combines the 5E Learning cycle with the STEAM approach. This research used 4D development model that consist of four stage i.e define, design, develop and dissemination. Results of the need assessment given to 10 teachers showed that only 10% of teachers applied STEAM in the class, while others use PBL, Discovery learning, and inquiry learning. As many as 70% of teachers do not know about 5E Learning Cycle, and as many as 30% only know but they have not implemented yet in learning. In addition, as many as 70% of teachers know only the acronyms of STEAM, but do not understand how to apply STEAM in learning. Moreover, the other 30% don’t know about the STEAM approach. The 5E-STEAM syntaxs are Engagement; stages provide real world problem. The second is Exploration; the stages of problem solving. The third is Explanation; students explain ideas or concepts about solutions to problems. The fourth is Elaboration; stresses collaborative teamwork.

The City as a Tool for STEAM Education: Problem-Posing in the Context of Math Trails,"This study presents an experience that combines problem-posing and Math Trails in the context of future teachers’ instruction. Pre-service teachers in the third year of their studies were faced with the design of tasks to be included in Math Trails for primary school students. The study analyzes, from a quantitative approach, 117 tasks contained in 11 Math Trails. The analysis was performed on the basis of classification variables (grade, mathematical content and object or real element involved in every task) and research variables which provide information about the nature of the tasks (procedural vs. problem-solving, level of cognitive demand, degree of contextualization, openness and creativity). Additionally, relationships between the different categories of analysis have been studied. The results reveal certain biases in the tasks in relation to the contents addressed (an abundance of tasks with a geometric component and a scarcity of tasks involving algebra or probability concepts). Most of the tasks are presented in a real context. However, a higher percentage of procedural tasks than problem-solving tasks is observed, with a predominance of low openness, creativity and cognitive demand. These results provide useful lines of work to address difficulties faced by future teachers in the STEAM field.",False,No,1.

The Rise of 2D Photothermal Materials beyond Graphene for Clean Water Production,"Water shortage is one of the most concerning global challenges in the 21st century. Solar‐inspired vaporization employing photothermal nanomaterials is considered to be a feasible and green technology for addressing the water challenge by virtue of abundant and clean solar energy. 2D nanomaterials aroused considerable attention in photothermal evaporation‐induced water production owing to their large absorption surface, strong absorption in broadband solar spectrum, and efficient photothermal conversion. Herein, the recent progress of 2D nanomaterials‐based photothermal evaporation, mainly including emerging Xenes (phosphorene, antimonene, tellurene, and borophene) and binary‐enes (MXenes and transition metal dichalcogenides), is reviewed. Then, the optimization strategies for higher evaporation performance are summarized in terms of modulation of the intrinsic photothermal performance of 2D nanomaterials and design of the complete evaporation system. Finally, the challenges and prospective of various kinds of 2D photothermal nanomaterials are discussed in terms of the photothermal performance, stability, environmental influence, and cost. One important principle is that solutions for water challenges should not introduce new environmental and social problems. This Review aims to highlight the role of 2D photothermal nanomaterials in solving water challenges and provides a viable scheme toward the practical use in photothermal materials selection, design, and evaporation systems building.",False,No,1.

"The STEAM Dance Makerspace: A Context for Integration: An Investigation of Learning at the Intersections of STEM, Art, Making and Embodiment","This dissertation is an ethnographic study of the dance makerspace, a learning environment designed to support STEM engagement through making and embodied experience for a group of African American youth dancers. It looks at how participants in a 4-week summer camp program at an urban creative arts center-turned-makerspace, constructed embodied understandings as they developed projects that integrated STEM, dance, and making. Through a detailed analysis of the dance makerspace design, and of participant engagement in activities, I investigated what it meant to do science in an informal out-of-school context, where activities were guided by children's interests and ideas, and where learning science was not necessarily the ultimate goal. In this dissertation, I will share analyses from the perspectives of designer, facilitator, and participant researcher, the three roles I played in the study. I examine how factors related to design and facilitation influenced youth engagement with STEM. I also examined dance as an interest, a representational medium, and a tool for sense-making, using ethnographic descriptions to show how and what youth learned as they engaged in embodied sense-making practices; and the relationships between STEM, art, making and the body when dance was used as a representational medium. This work brings readers inside the making process and demonstrates the potential for conceptual learning outcomes in informal STEAM making spaces. The findings show how the design and facilitation of activities created opportunities for youth to engage meaningfully in STEM in ways that are nontraditional, utilize their bodies for sense-making, and integrate STEM and arts practices. These findings further our understanding of STEAM learning in makerspaces, and they have broader theoretical and methodological implications. First, the study lends empirical support to research on making to learn by demonstrating how STEAM making can lead to conceptual understanding. It also expands ways of perceiving the body's role in cognition and sense-making, broadening definitions of cognition, and provides evidence to counter characterizations of cognition that separate mind and body. Further, the study provides methods for evaluating learning in informal settings where learning goals are not based on specific science content, and particularly when the products being evaluated are multimodal and non-verbal.

The Story of 13 Moons: Developing an Environmental Health and Sustainability Curriculum Founded on Indigenous First Foods and Technologies,"The Swinomish Indian Tribal Community developed an informal environmental health and sustainability (EHS) curriculum based on Swinomish beliefs and practices. EHS programs developed and implemented by Indigenous communities are extremely scarce. The mainstream view of EHS does not do justice to how many Indigenous peoples define EHS as reciprocal relationships between people, nonhuman beings, homelands, air, and waters. The curriculum provides an alternative informal educational platform for teaching science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) using identification, harvest, and preparation activities of First Foods and medicines that are important to community members in order to increase awareness and understanding of local EHS issues. The curriculum, called 13 Moons, is founded on a set of guiding principles which may be useful for other Indigenous communities seeking to develop their own curricula.",False,No,1.

The Student-Self Oriented Learning Model as an Effective Paradigm for Education in Knowledge Society,"Proceeding from broadly accepted role of emotional intelligence (EI) in professional and personal life, the paper suggests a new learning model (LM) called Student-Self Oriented LM (SSOL-model). It is defined as the model being beneficial for self-cognition and self-construction through the prism of the acquired knowledge and life experience. Two successful implementations of the SSOL-model are shortly described: the system of emotional-imaginative teaching (the EIT-system) developed by the authors in the 1990s and expanded in the 2000s and art cognitonics. The EIT-system is underpinned by the authors' Theory of Dynamic Conceptual Mappings (the DCM-theory). The EIT-system includes an original method of developing figurative thinking and creativity at the lessons of second language (English for Russian children), literature and poetry in English and Russian, symbolic language of painting, and communication culture. It is stated that this method may be used as an effective starting framework of STEAM education. It is mentioned that the DCM-theory and the EIT-system became the starting point for developing the foundations of a new scientific discipline called cognitonics. The basic principles of art cognitonics - a well developed branch of cognitonics and the concept of cognitive engagement are described. The significance of art cognitonics for helping the learners to answer the encountered moral questions is explained. The broad possibilities of designing intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) of new generation are indicated. These are culture and moral experience oriented systems aimed at developing figurative thinking, creativity, early socialization and helping the students to find in the outstanding art works the answers to emerging moral questions. An original, detailed script of an ITS contributing to early socialization of the learners is described, its literary source is the fairy-tale ""Sleeping Beauty"". Since the sphere of using the SSOL-model is not restricted, it is suggested to interpret this model as an effective paradigm for education in knowledge society and a strong support to anthropocentric approach to education in the digital age.",False,No,1.

They’re Moving in Spaces They’re Not Used to: Examining the Racialized Experiences of African American Students in a High School STEAM Academy,"In this study, we explored how an urban high school with a STEAM (Science, Technology, Arts, and Mathematics) theme approached racialized student experiences as learning opportunities. We were interested in documenting curricular and pedagogical practices, and the mission of the STEAM Academy, which was aimed at exposing African American/Black students to possibilities beyond the school including university settings and workplace environments (through job shadowing and internships). Based on the perspectives of school personnel and community partners, we found the school administrators and teachers enacted social justice–centered curricular strategies to elicit emancipatory and participatory actions for administrators, teachers, and students. This type of curriculum for students helped them cope with the stressors of encountering racialized experiences and microaggressions in the school and beyond; thereby, enabling them to be resilient in the face of a discriminatory and oppressive society.",False,No,1.

Time Keeping Experiments For A Mechanical Engineering Education Laboratory Sequence,"The evolution of science and technology throughout history parallels the development of time keeping devices which assist mankind in measuring and coordinating their daily schedules. The earliest clocks used the natural behavior of the sun, sand, and water to approximate fixed time intervals. In the medieval period, mechanical clocks were introduced that were driven by weights and springs which offered greater time accuracy due to improved design and materials. In the last century, electric motor driven clocks and digital circuits have allowed for widespread distribution of clock devices to many homes and individuals. In this paper, a series of eight laboratory experiments have been created which use a time keeping theme to introduce basic mechanical and electrical engineering concepts, while offering the opportunity to weave societal implications into the discussions. These bench top and numerical studies include clock movements, pendulums, vibration and acoustic analysis, material properties, circuit breadboards, microprocessor programming, computer simulation, and artistic water clocks. For each experiment, the learning objectives, equipment and materials, and laboratory procedures are listed. To determine the learning effectiveness of each experiment, an assessment tool will be used to gather student feedback for laboratory improvement. Finally, these experiments can also be integrated into academic programs that emphasize science, technology, engineering and mathematical concepts within a societal context. 1.0 Introduction The common clock, whether mechanical, electric or electronic, represents a dynamic system whose precision and sophistication has evolved with society as well as the interpretation of time. A clock generally contains a host of scientific and engineering principles which make them an ideal system for study by students since they represent practical real world applications. The span of clock technology includes physics (pendulums), fluids (water, sand), metallurgy (springs, cases), mechanisms (gear trains, levers), thermodynamics (air or Atmos clock), feedback control (escapement), mathematics (harmonic motion), electric motors, electronics (clock chip), computer programming (digital clock), and radioactive decay (atomic clock). Time keeping devices fulfill an important societal by allowing the coordination of personal, commerce, and transportation activities. It has been suggested by Mumford1 that “the clock, not the steam engine, is the key machine of the modern industrial age”. Given the familiarity and general knowledge of clocks by students and people of all ages, these time keeping devices represent an ideal medium for engineering discovery and creativity through focused laboratory experiments. A short review of selected mechanical engineering education laboratories and clock learning materials will be presented. Knight and McDonald2 discussed the senior level mechanical engineering laboratory at the University of Tennessee which seeks to balance mechanical and thermal system experiments. The identification of learning objectives within the mechanical engineering laboratory sequence at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology has been addressed by Layton et al.3. Yoder et al.4 discussed a revised senior control systems engineering laboratory with student assessment at Ohio Northern University.

Towards Closing STEAM Diversity Gaps: A Grey Review of Existing Initiatives,"Although STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art, and math) and student-centered instruction are growing rapidly in popularity, their reach is not adequately distributed across diversity groups (including individuals of different genders, economic backgrounds, immigrant backgrounds, abilities, and races, among other characteristics). The CreaSTEAM project intends to address diversity gaps by developing STEAM-Labs, student-centered spaces that combine components of fab labs, media labs, and user labs to specifically target diversity gaps. This paper carried out an informal PRISMA systematic review of a collection of 124 worldwide STEAM diversity initiatives to gather data on existing best practices that will be used in the STEAM-Labs. The review studied the geographic distributions, organizational structures, founding years, and activity offerings of the initiatives, along with the dataset’s overall STEAM content area prevalence and diversity target area prevalence. STEM was the most common approach, and gender was the most common diversity target area. Since 2010 initiative creation has increased, with most growth in gender-focused initiatives.",False,No,1.

Transformation of STEM to STEAM – How a Traditionally Run STEM Camp Successfully Incorporated the Arts into its Framework Resulting in a Successful STEAM Camp (Work in Progress),"Transformation of STEM to STEAM – How a traditionally run STEM camp successfully incorporated the ARTS into its framework resulting in a successful STEAM Camp (Work in Progress)The summer of 2014 marked a transition from STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math)to STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, ARTS, Math) with the incorporation of the Artsinto an existing informal educational model used to enhance K-12 education in an out-of-schoolprogram – a day camp experience for 60 children. This camp infused fun with ART intoengaging activities alongside pointed educational modules to teach 4th-6th grade campers how theSTEAM fields work together to create “Our Beautiful World”; and how they influence themovement towards a more sustainable lifestyle. We operated under the Brundtland Report’sdefinition of sustainability as “development which meets the needs of the present withoutcompromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. Themes ofsustainability and “Our Beautiful World” were incorporated into each of the twelve modules.Modules spanned over four days, and were to be integrated into a final group project- where eachgroup created a balanced community on the template of an island that was provided.Campers were split into six groups of 10; stratified by age. Each group was assigned a color-Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple- and 1-2 camp counselors. Counselors broughttheir group through each day with a provided daily schedule, broken up by time, and module.Module presenters, counselors, and other helpers were recruited chiefly on a volunteer basisfrom faculty, summer research students, local high schools, community partners, and familyfriends. All adults completed a Lafayette background check in order to work with children.To empirically measure the academic success of the camp, campers were given a pre and postsurvey to be completed. Parents and campers gave informed consent with an IRB-approvedform that was collected and kept in a secure location. Each camper was assigned a number towrite in lieu of their name of their pre and post surveys. Pre-surveys were given to all groups atthe start of camp before any modules or activities were completed. Post surveys were given tocampers after all modules and activities were completed, before the final group projectpresentation, where campers explained their group’s overarching project to their parents. Thecampers were also asked to draw a picture of their Beautiful World in relation to STEAM fieldsduring pre-surveys, to be added onto during post surveys in a different color.Intended learner outcomes include an increased cognizance of the environment andsustainability, the role of the Arts in the STEM fields how they can enhance practices,identification of how an individual can change their behavior to live more sustainability, as wellas the identification of how society can change present behaviors to help maintain the planet’slimited supply of resources for future generations.",False,No,1.

Unlocking Learning II: Math as a Lever for English Learner Equity,"Wide and persistent gaps in math achievement separate English learners from their English-proficient peers. The consequences of these gaps are severe and long lasting. Without a solid foundation in math, students are less likely to access and excel in college preparatory math and science classes in high school. Without high-level math classes in high school, students have fewer college and career opportunities, especially in the STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) fields that are increasingly in high demand in California. Indeed, these gaps threaten the very wellbeing of the state's future, in terms of lost human and economic potential. This report, the second in The Education Trust-West's ""Unlocking Learning"" series, aims to illuminate the promising practices in math education that advance access, opportunity, and achievement for English learners in California.

Using A Delphi Study To Define A Curriculum For Service Systems Engineering,"The U.S. economy has gradually changed from one based in agriculture, to one focused on manufacturing, to one now that relies heavily on the service sector. The service sector, including governmental agencies, retail stores, the entertainment business, public utilities, and providers of similar services, now makes up more than 80% of the total U.S. economy. Engineering programs, which typically have their roots in the era of manufacturing, have a focus on the design and fabrication of “products” rather than the design and creation of service systems. While curricula such as engineering management and industrial engineering provide some support to service systems engineering, their legacies are tied to the manufacturing sector, and as a result, they are not optimized to support the service sector. With this in mind, a Delphi Study was performed to identify the features, characteristics, and topics relevant to a service systems engineering curriculum. This paper describes the planning, conduct, and results of the service systems engineering Delphi Study and how this information is being used to establish a new degree program. The modern-day engineering profession has its origin in the 14th century when individuals such as Leonardo daVinci were hired to design better weapons or better defenses, depending on the client.3 Early engineers were engaged in the art of war – building better roads, bridges, and sanitation systems. Soon, the civilian population demanded luxuries such as those afforded the army, giving birth to civil engineering. With the dawn of the Industrial Age, mechanical engineering evolved to feed the need for individuals who could design and build efficient steam- powered machinery. Electrical and chemical engineering soon followed as the standard of living continued to improve in the developed world. Engineering disciplines have continuously evolved throughout history, giving birth to disciplines such as biomedical, computer, and aerospace. Throughout its long history, however, the engineering profession has been clearly focused on designing better devices, mechanisms, objects, and the processes used to realize these articles. At the same time the engineering profession evolved to meet the needs of society, the economic basis for society also changed dramatically, due in large part to the technological advances that were developed. Two hundred years ago, the economy was primarily based on agricultural production. Manufacturing superceded agriculture in terms of size, employment, and importance during the twentieth century. Today’s economy is based largely upon the service sector, with the service sector now accounting for nearly 80% of all economic activity in the U.S., far “Proceedings of the 2005 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Copyright © 2005, American Society for Engineering Education”",False,No,1.

Using design thinking to cultivate the next generation of female STEAM thinkers,"Background Countries around the world have struggled to implement education policies and practices to encourage more female youths to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This has resulted in a persistent and sizeable gender gap in science and mathematics subjects in some countries. Using mixed-methods sequential explanatory design, this paper explores an educational intervention—specifically, a 3-day design thinking workshop—in Japan, designed to change female youths’ perceptions regarding STEM topics. Framed using a constructivist approach to learning, the workshops aimed to engender creative confidence, empathy, and global competence among youths. Results The findings show that female youths who participated in the workshop had increased interest in engineering, greater creative confidence, more positive perceptions of STEM, higher levels of empathy and pro-social factors, and a more varied outlook on career options. We argue that this short intervention had a strong influence on the female youths’ mindsets, self-images, and perceptions of STEM. Conclusion This study provides empirical support that a short intervention can produce positive change in how female youths relate to STEM. In gendered societies, an innovative method like design thinking has the potential to revitalize education curriculum in ways that spur female youths’ confidence and creativity, enabling them to imagine a career in the field of STEM.",False,No,1.

Window to the World,"Although formal papers are typical, sometimes posters or other visual presentations are more useful tools for sharing visual-spatial information. By incorporating creativity and technology into the study of geographical science, STEM (the study of Science, Technology Engineering, and Mathematics) is changed to STEAM (the A stands for ART)! The guiding structure of this activity is geographic inquiry, as described in the ""3C Framework for Social Studies Standards."" The Window to the World Project began as a middle-grades classroom activity where students looked at their individual strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats using a SWOT Analysis Chart. Then, they explored their interests, hobbies, and possible future endeavors, narrowing down ideas for research. Once they determined one possible interest or passion, they explored the feasibility of spending multiple days working on a geography project based on that one interest. All the while, the teacher guided the students through an exploration based on what Gersmehl describes as the ""Four Cornerstones of Geography (Gersmehl, 2014). Their WINDOWS are visual stories expressing individual interests and connections to different locations, places, and spaces on Earth. Students presented their windows in a common area outside the school cafeteria in a ""Window Session."" In this lesson, students construct a ""window to the world"" foldable world geography project that reflects their personal interests. The lesson can be geared toward elementary, intermediate, or high school classes and takes 3-5 hours to complete.",False,No,1.

Young Makers Compare Science Fairs and Maker Faires,"Participation in the school-based science fair is ubiquitous to the middle-school student. Rising in popularity is the community based, extracurricular Maker Faire for the young tinkerer or maker. With this study, we share perceptions of these 2 canonical STEM events from the perspective of Young Makers. We report on the perceptions of science fairs and Maker Fairs from the perspective of 35 young Makers ages 7-18, who participated in a flagship Maker Faires in the United States. Using thematic analysis we analyze their responses during qualitative interviews and report on their impressions of their science fairs and Maker Faires experiences. Both science fairs and Maker Faires present authentic STEM learning opportunities for the K-12 student. They have similar formats where the student presents work that they have done, both the process and end product or result. Opportunities often arise in both to engage and excite a student in an area of curiosity. Both types of fairs want their participants to interact with each other and provide each other with feedback and a learning environment. They also want the participants to well document their projects. Emerging themes indicate both similarities and differences and how those affect the projects represented in each. Both types of fairs are unique and provide a learning experience for their respective participants. Participating in Maker Faires is, study participants believe, provides more applied learning about science, engineering, and community concepts as compared to their participation in science fairs. Maker Faires may provide an opportunity for schools to promote deeper learning. Additional analysis will explore this further. An example of a science fair is the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, around since the 1950s. ISEF materials define science fair as “research [as]… a process by which people discover or create new knowledge about the world in which they live…Students design research projects that provide quantitative data through experimentation followed by analysis and application of that data.” Specific learning objectives are learning the scientific method, answering a question, and communicating their research clearly. The science fair also offers an opportunity for feedback on how their project compares to others in a competitive school setting (with awards at the local, regional and national competition level). Organizers describe Maker Faire as “part science fair, part county fair, and part something entirely new, …an all-ages gathering of tech enthusiasts, crafters, educators, tinkerers, hobbyists, engineers, science clubs, authors, artists, students, and commercial exhibitors.” Maker Faires have become increasingly popular since inception more than 10 years ago, with attendance at flagship Bay Area Maker Faire reaching 130,000 and 85,000 at the flagship New York Maker Faire. Aims are promoting self-motivated learning, give makers a place to freely show of their project, and to be transformation educational experience. An increasing trend is bringing making activities to K-12 in the classroom, in collaborative maker spaces, and through clubs. This may allow for opportunities to benefit from both science fairs and Maker Faires, including a new initiative to have Maker Faires at schools. We will present implications for STEM and STEAM informal learning and means to engage in STEM, and particularly engineering, in and outside of the science classroom in K-12 education.",False,No,2.

"""Finding the Joy in the Unknown"": Implementation of STEAM Teaching Practices in Middle School Science and Math Classrooms","In response to a desire to strengthen the economy, educational settings are emphasizing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curriculum and programs. Yet, because of the narrow approach to STEM, educational leaders continue to call for a more balanced approach to teaching and learning, which includes the arts, design, and humanities. This desire created space for science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education, a transdisciplinary approach that focuses on problem-solving. STEAM-based curricula and STEAM-themed schools are appearing all over the globe. This growing national and global attention to STEAM provides an opportunity for teacher education to explore the ways in which teachers implement STEAM practices, examining the successes and challenges, and how teachers are beginning to make sense of this innovative teaching practice. The purpose of this paper is to examine the implementation of STEAM teaching practices in science and math middle school classrooms, in hopes to provide research-based evidence on this emerging topic to guide teacher educators.",True,No,4.

A Study of Pre-Algebra Learning in the Context of a Computer Game-Making Course,"A Study of Pre-Algebra Learning in the Context of a Computer Game-Making Course Blind SubmissionAbstractIn this paper, we report the outcomes of the first implementation of [a new pre-algebra learningcurriculum based on game design]. The curriculum is the result of a National Science Foundation[program] grant to explore novel ways to teach standards-based content and 21st century skill tounderperforming high school students in Los Angeles. The project’s goals are to addressretention, career education and secondary mathematics learning. Game design is being used toengage students and to provide a grounding context for the mathematics. The effort is meetingthe challenge of teaching math across the curriculum and is leading to the development of newstrategies to embed mathematics in authentic contexts.PedagogyLearning in the context of computer game making is best framed by the philosophy ofConstructionism, which is the idea that learning is most effective when part of an activity thelearner experiences as constructing a meaningful product (Papert, 1987; also Kafai, 2008).Following a recent trend in STEM education, the program uses a STEM to STEAM (Science,Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) approach to learning, which is the practice ofintegrating art and/or design with traditional STEM learning to increase interest and impact(Maeda, 2013). The importance of the practice is being recognized at high levels (Bonamici,2013).MethodologyDuring the fall of 2011, fifty students participated in a pilot program to study mathematicslearning in the context of making computer games. During class students created two differentgames – a maze game (e.g. PacMan) and a shooting scroller game (e.g. Space Invaders). Eachgame exercised a different set of mathematical concepts. Game making classes were interspersedwith activities that involved mathematics directly, for example, including doing worksheets andplaying math games; or indirectly, for example, manipulating math concepts that occurred whilemaking games. Students took short self-quizzes after each step of the game making process toreinforce concepts. Pre and post math tests were administered before and after students createdgames. The results of learning gains from pre-test to post-test are reported on here.ResultsData from pre and post tests were analyzed The highest learning gains for the maze gameoccurred in graphing and rates concepts, as well as fractions, percentages and factors. Thehighest for the shooter game occurred in the average, length, percent and probability calculations.[Extra Page for Figures and References]ResultsFigure 1 Maze test (top) and shooter test (bottom) results.

An Experimental Study on the Implementation of a STEAM-Based Learning Module in Science Education,"Over the last decade, there has been notable academic interest in the multidisciplinary studies of science education with the emergence of STEAM. Accordingly, this study aimed to conduct an experimental study to explore the effectiveness of a STEAM-based space-themed learning module in science education taught to primary school students. The sample of the study was 6th- and 7th-grade students from the Central Anatolia Region of Turkiye. The experimental group consisted of 180 students, whereas the control group consisted of 94 students. The STEAM-based learning module was applied to the students in the experimental group, and the traditional lecture-based approach was applied to students in the control group. The traditional education and intervention lasted eight weeks. The chi-square test and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the differences and associations between the variables. The results indicated that gender and academic achievement level were the two key factors determining the effectiveness of the STEAM-based learning module. The comparison of the pre-test and post-test scores indicated that the scores of the female students who participated in the module increased the most. This suggested that girls benefited more from the STEAM-based learning module than boys. Further, the lecture-based approach led to a decrease in some high-achieving students. The findings have implications for educational policymakers, curriculum developers, and syllabus designers.",True,No,4.

Astro-animation: A case study of art and science education,"Art and science are different ways of exploring the world, but together they have the potential to be thought-provoking, facilitate a science–society dialogue, raise public awareness of science and develop an understanding of art. For several years, we have been teaching an astro-animation class at the Maryland Institute College of Art as a collaboration between students and NASA scientists. Working in small groups, the students create short animations based on the research of the scientists who are going to follow the projects as mentors. By creating these animations, students bring the power of their imagination to see the research of the scientists through a different lens. Astro-animation is an undergraduate-level course jointly taught by an astrophysicist and an animator. In this article, we present the motivation behind the class, describe the details of how it is carried out and discuss the interactions between artists and scientists. We describe how such a programme offers an effective way for art students, not only to learn about science but to have a glimpse of ‘science in action’. The students have the opportunity to become involved in the process of science as artists, as observers first and potentially through their own art research. Every year, one or more internships at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center have been available for our students in the summer. Two students describe their experiences undertaking these internships and how science affects their creation of animations for this programme and in general. We also explain the genesis of our astro-animation programme, how it is taught in our animation department and we present the highlights of an investigation of the effectiveness of this programme we carried out with the support of an NEA research grant. In conclusion, we discuss how the programme may grow in new directions, such as contributing to informal STE(A)M learning.",True,No,4.

Cases on Models and Methods for STEAM Education. Advances in Educational Technologies and Instructional Design (AETID) Book Series,"STEAM education can be described in two ways. One model emphasizes the arts and is not as concerned about the accuracy of the STEM fields. In the second model, STEM content is the prevailing force with a focus on accuracy, and the arts are used in limited and secondary resources for the teaching of the content. However, in order to promote creative thinking, allow for higher student engagement, and offer a more well-rounded education, a STEAM model, where science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics are equal contributors to the process of learning, is needed. ""Cases on Models and Methods for STEAM Education"" is an important scholarly resource that provides inclusive models and case studies highlighting best techniques and practices for implementing STEAM models in teaching and assists teachers as they learn to use such methods through the inclusion of practical activities for use in the classroom. Highlighting a wide range of topics such as science education, fine arts, and teaching models, this book is essential for educators, administrators, curriculum developers, instructional designers, policymakers, academicians, researchers, and students.

"Celestial calendar-paintings and culture-based digital storytelling: cross-cultural, interdisciplinary, STEM/STEAM resources for authentic astronomy education engagement","In D(L)akota star knowledge, the Sun is known as Wi and the Moon is Han-Wi. They have an important relationship, husband and wife. The pattern of their ever-changing relationship is mirrored in the motions of Sun and Moon as seen from our backyards, also called the lunar phases. The framework of the cultural teaching is storytelling and relationships. Cultural perspectives in astronomy such as this remind us of how indigenous ways of knowing are rooted in inclusion, engagement, and relevancy. Designed by A. Lee in 2007, the Native Skywatchers initiative seeks to remember and revitalize indigenous star and earth knowledge, promoting the native voice as the lead voice. The overarching goal of Native Skywatchers is to communicate the knowledge that indigenous people traditionally practiced a sustainable way of living and sustainable engineering through a living and participatory relationship with the above and below, sky and earth. In 2012 two indigenous star maps were created: the Ojibwe Giizhig Anung Masinaaigan-Ojibwe Sky Star Map (A. Lee, W. Wilson, C. Gawboy), and the D(L)akota star map, Makoce Wicanhpi Wowapi (A. Lee, J. Rock). In 2016, a collaboration with W. Buck of the Manitoba First Nations Resource Centre (MFNRC), produced a third star map: Ininew Achakos Masinikan-Cree Star Map Book. We aim to improve current inequities in education for native young people especially through STEM engagement, to inspire increased cultural pride, and promote community wellness. Presented here will be recently created resources such as: astronomical calendar-paintings and short videos that exist at the intersection of art-science-culture.

Changing the World for Good: Tech Trek Alabama Changes 8th Grade Girls’ Attitudes Towards STEM,"Changing the World for Good: Tech Trek Alabama Changes 8th Grade Girls’ Attitudes Towards STEM The American Association of University Women (AAUW) research report ”Why SoFew? Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)” found thatwomen are vastly underrepresented in STEM majors and fields compared with their male peers.But “Why So Few?” also showed that those numbers can change when girls realize theirpotential in STEM at an early age. In 2012, AAUW decided to provide girls across the countrythe opportunity to immerse themselves in hands-on exploration of STEM topics in order toencourage them to take more advanced STEM classes in high school and go on to major inSTEM fields in college. Using the model developed in California, AAUW brought Tech Trek, aweeklong summer camp for rising eighth-grade girls that is designed to develop interest,excitement, and self-confidence in STEM through classes, workshops, hands-on activities, andfield trips to four national sites in 2013.The inaugural Alabama Tech Trek camp, a partnership between the local AAUW branch andInstitution was held July 20-25, 2014. The girls spent 17.5 hours in core classes, choosing fromrobotics, app development, and life science. They also gained exposure to additional areas ofSTEM through workshops, a field trip, and evening activities. Technical workshops includedinstant challenges conducted by trained evaluators from Destination Imagination, rocket buildingand the engineering design process led by NASA Education, and DNA extraction at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. Non-technical presentations included communicating your bigidea, STEAM, and stress release. The campers also toured a prototyping facility at Dynetics, Inc.and took the Ultimate Math Field Trip challenge at the US Space and Rocket Center. Thehighlight of the week was the Professional Women’s Night, an event that involved professionalsrotating among groups of girls, speed dating style.Significant Findings: The number of girls strongly agreeing with the statement “I plan to takeadvanced science and math courses in high school” went from 34 in the pre-camp survey to 39 inthe post-camp survey, an increase of 14.7 %. The number of girls strongly agreeing with thestatement “I’m thinking of having a career in science or technology” went from 24 in the pre-camp survey to 38 in the post-camp survey, an increase of 58.3 %.",True,No,4.

Curriculum Exchange: “The Art of Engineering”: a Four-Year Project-Based High School Curriculum,"Curriculum Exchange: “The Art of Engineering”: a Four-Year Project- Based High School CurriculumA teacher who is the recipient of a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship is implementing a newfour-year project-based STEAM curriculum. The program is designed to give students a real-world, interdisciplinary, project-based approach to learning. The program strives to create abalance between theory and application.The course sequence includes the following dedicated classes: • 9th Grade: Engineering Technology • 10th Grade: Engineering Sculpture and Design • 11th Grade: Engineering Physics • 12th Grade: Advanced Engineering Physics and FIRST Robotics (double-length class)All classes use project-based learning, i.e., the use of classroom projects to facilitate learning andassess student competence. This instructional method provides students with complex tasksbased on challenging questions or problems that involve the students’ problem-solving, decision-making, and investigative skills. Students develop valuable research and design skills. Project-based learning promotes new learning habits that emphasize creative thinking.During their first three years of study, 100 students per grade are enrolled in an integratedproject-based curriculum that collectively covers, in an interdisciplinary fashion, the contentcontained in 1) a standard laboratory science physics course, 2) a standard visual and performingarts sculpture course, and 3) an engineering elective course. These courses are taught by a teamof five teachers, who are credentialed in physics, visual and performing arts, and engineeringtechnology. Content is covered in a completely integrated, interdisciplinary fashion. Thesequence provides credit for a year each of physical science, visual arts, and an elective.Two projects will be presented here: 1) Students construct a hanging mobile. The sculpture has multiple moving parts and is colored to enhance the form. Elements and principles of design include line, shape, color, movement, balance, and space. Students use tools associated with engineering technology such as calipers, and electronic balances. Students calculate the force of gravity acting on each object and calculate all necessary torques and forces for balance. Students fabricate fasteners that allow elements of the mobile to be adjusted during assembly. 2) Students build a programmable light sculpture. The sculpture has a metal housing that is fabricated by the students. The sculpture consists of acrylic rods, which are machined by the students and then mounted in the housing. Students will use soldering irons, build a DC circuit board and wire the components together. The rods are lighted in color from below. The housing contains an Arduino computer that controls the timing and color changes of the sculpture. The students use the open-source Arduino platform to program their light sculpture.",True,No,4.

Dancing with STEAM: Creative Movement Generates Electricity for Young Learners,"The integration of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) serves to develop creative thinking and twenty-first-century skills in the classroom (Maeda 2012). Learning through STEAM promotes novelty, innovation, ingenuity, and task-specific purposefulness to solve real-world problems--all aspects that define creativity. Lisa Fanning is a fifth-grade teacher at a public elementary school with school-wide arts integration at the core of its vision. Fanning participated in a district-wide professional development project through which she partnered with a dance teaching artist. Together with her partner, she engaged in a 12-hour workshop to develop common understandings about curricular intersections, practiced co-teaching structures, and devised essential questions to guide their lesson planning. They subsequently engaged in 24 hours of additional professional development during a summer institute to learn specific methodology in dance integration, including elements, strategies, and facilitation techniques. During the summer institute, Jamie Simpson Steele (a performing arts specialist) and Lori Fulton (a science educator) provided a framework for thinking about STEAM intersections and examples of art and science integrated experiences for teachers and teaching artists. Next, Fanning and her teaching artist partner co-planned and co-taught a semester-long inquiry to investigate this question: How does energy transform? This inquiry engaged students in hands-on activities, field-based experiences, interviews with experts, science notebooks, creative movement improvisation, dance choreography, and a call for social activism. The collaborations consisted of ten sessions of planning time and ten co-taught lessons in the classroom. Fanning's unit focused on the properties of wind and how its energy could be stored, transformed, and transferred for use. The science objective required students to describe how later when they engineered turbines). To explore the relationship among the earth, sea, and sky, students connected to their personal experiences at the beach and did further observation and research. Students converted these ideas into a model by expanding, rising, and pushing their bodies through space. Finally, students responded to the work of their peers, practicing artistic thinking by observing, describing, and interpreting each other's movements (Harris 2013). The unit culminated in a public performance with invited parents and community members. During this sharing, students performed original choreography, exhibited wind turbines, led station activities to inform their guests about the wind as a source of energy, and engaged in a mock demonstration advocating for renewable energy.",True,No,4.

Development of Spatial Abilities of Preadolescents: What Works?,"Creation in space and perception of spatial relations are important workplace skills that can be successfully developed in public education through the cooperation of art education, mathematics, and technology, the STEAM model that has been successfully employed in higher education. In a longitudinal school-based experiment, we enhanced the spatial skills of preadolescents through a STEAM-based educational programme. To design our methods of intervention in mathematics, visual arts, and information technology, we used the structure of spatial skills identified in previous studies. Developmental methods involved two- and three-dimensional visualisation tasks in real-life and virtual learning environments. We employed a pre- and post-hoc assessment design using a spatial ability task sequence standardised in Hungary that proved to be valid for assessing Slovak students as well. Authentic assessment tasks included real-life situations when visualisations of spatial relations were used for orientation and creation. Pre-test results showed significant differences between school classes: we identified high achievers and middle-to-low achievers. Our developmental programme was aimed at personalised talent development in the high-achieving classes and the general improvement of the performance of low achievers, raising insufficient pre-test results to an average post-test performance.",True,No,4.

Educate Utilizing CubeSat Experience: Unified K-20 Vision of Comprehensive STEAM-Powered Space Systems Education Program,"Educate Utilizing CubeSat Experience: Unified K-20 Vision of Comprehensive STEAM-Powered Space Systems Education ProgramEducate Utilizing CubeSat Experience (EdUCE) debuted in 2010 as a K-20 Science,Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education program using space-derivedactivities with an emphasis on design and development of CubeSats. CubeSats originallywere introduced to train and expose university students and faculty to holistic spacecraftresearch and development. Recently, the inclusion of the Arts (resulting in STEAM) hasbecome a complementary effort to engage students/educators in activities and to motivateinnovation in Systems Engineering curriculum. This paper discusses a new systematicapproach which (i) utilizes a Backward Design approach to develop coherent end-to-endsystem engineering content and (ii) delivers this content through state-of-the-art digitalplatforms. Specifically, the following hypothesis-driven questions are investigated: • How does the design of the EdUCE program meet STEAM standards and expectations? • How is Systems Engineering (in particular design and development of CubeSats) correlated to the Backward Design approach that is adopted in educational curriculum? • How to use the arts to complement the understanding of STEM concepts with a focus on Systems Engineering? • How are digital platforms (i.e., interactive books, Web 2.0 and mobile apps) paired with hands-on activities an effective mechanism to enable learning? • What best practices have been targeted and implemented for dissemination of EdUCE?Backward Design approach is a tool used in elementary and secondary education to developcurricula and teaching lessons which involves the following phases: (1) determination of thelearning outcomes, (2) development of the assessments, and (3) design of the learningexperience; essentially, the process has the end in mind by first, identify the learning goals,next identify the metrics required to measure success, then finally design/implement thelearning activities to meet these goals, thus creating a systematic path. The SystemsEngineering process shares lots of parallelisms with Backward Design; it begins with a need(i.e., objective), assesses alternatives and designs and develops products and activities (i.e.,verification and validation, operations, sustainment, and retirement) to satisfy the need in asystematic way.Via this approach, educators and techinical subject matter experts collaborate in thedevelopment process and manage age appropriate curriculum, thus unifying and broadeningboth the number and quality of K-20 participants worldwide. To demonstrate, an example ofengaging curriculum is presented. The end-to-end design and development process and thelife experiences from a CubeSat program are the major contributing factors in engaging theparticipants, however, complementary space activities, such as microgravity experiments,high altitude balloon experiments, and CanSats are included.

Engineering the Future Workforce Required by a Global Engineering Industry,"Engineering the Future Workforce required by a Global Engineering IndustryThe last decades have brought numerous changes to the engineering workforce. These changeshave been caused both by the increased specialization of skills required by the continuousapplication of innovative technologies and the geopolitical changes enabling global collaborationof engineering design teams. These phenomena, coupled with challenges in the workforcedemographics have created an environment requiring dramatic changes in the way that youth andadolescents in primary, secondary, and post-secondary education are educated to ensure theirfuture career success.While individual teachers have made great strides in improving the learning of their individualstudents to accommodate the requirements of a global workforce in the 21st century overallengineering companies and governmental agencies are challenged by the quantity and quality ofgraduates produced by the education system at all levels. To solve this dilemma a very largeaerospace company and a national space agency have jointly engineered a program inpartnership with educational institutions which prepares students with skills in the Science,Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) areas and does so collaborativelyacross the nation.While the very large aerospace company and governmental space agency have various educationprograms at all levels of the education system, this paper will focus on the joint efforts to engagevarious engineering universities and secondary education institutions across the United States byhaving geographically-dispersed, student teams comprised of members from various universitieswork together to solve an epic engineering challenge. These epic challenges address issues ofglobal concern, e.g., capturing and retrieving an asteroid, monitoring agricultural fields toincrease yield, or assisting first responders, and require a multidisciplinary skill set. This paperwill define the detailed processes required for such a multi-organizational endeavor, rangingfrom the recruitment and organization of partners, to the development of a joint curriculum andexecution of the program. These processes are based on the experiences, by both the very largeaerospace company and governmental space agency, in successfully carrying such multi-stakeholders initiatives within the education systems.While both organizations represented by the authors are aware of the limitations andshortcomings of the current education system, a paradigm change cannot be implementedovernight. This paper will therefor also detail how the jointly engineered program satisfiesABET criteria and will contrast benefits with traditional programs. In addition, a framework willbe presented that will enable the application of these processes to primary and secondaryeducation enabling students to have validated skills that are directly related to national scienceand engineering standards as well as workforce requirements. It is the intention of bothorganizations to leverage their respective technical expertise to engineer a multifunctionalsystems that can provide a workforce based on national objectives and industry requirements.",True,No,4.

"EXPLORIA, STEAM Education at University Level as a New Way to Teach Engineering Mechanics in an Integrated Learning Process","The objective of our research is the implementation of STEAM (Science Technology Engineering Art Mathematics) learning in the bachelor of Engineering in industrial design and product development at CEU Cardenal Herrera University through the EXPLORIA project. This article implements and develops the proposal for the first year of this bachelor, which includes 24 students aged 18–20. This article focuses on how to integrate STEAM learning within the EXPLORIA project for the improvement in the learning of the physics subject, and in particular, regarding the part of the syllabus related to mechanical engineering through different projects, challenges and milestones that allow the student to see the use in the design and development of products. The EXPLORIA project connects the competencies of the different STEAM subjects included in the bachelor, designing a learning process as a logical, sequential and incremental itinerary. Through concepts on which the fundamentals of design are based: shape, volume, color, space and structure. In particular, this article shows the adaptation made in the physical part to be able to teach the integrated mechanics part in this learning process. The complete learning was carried out through several challenges and two milestones the students had to overcome through the application of the physical knowledge learned in class. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, at the end of the paper, an ad hoc questionnaire is carried out showing the students’ assessment regarding the new teaching methodology.",True,No,4.

Global root zone storage capacity from satellite-based evaporation,"This study presents an “Earth observation-based” method for estimating root zone storage capacity – a critical, yet uncertain parameter in hydrological and land surface modelling. By assuming that vegetation optimises its root zone storage capacity to bridge critical dry periods, we were able to use state-of-the-art satellite-based evaporation data computed with independent energy balance equations to derive gridded root zone storage capacity at global scale. This approach does not require soil or vegetation information, is model independent, and is in principle scale independent. In contrast to a traditional look-up table approach, our method captures the variability in root zone storage capacity within land cover types, including in rainforests where direct measurements of root depths otherwise are scarce. Implementing the estimated root zone storage capacity in the global hydrological model STEAM (Simple Terrestrial Evaporation to Atmosphere Model) improved evaporation simulation overall, and in particular during the least evaporating months in sub-humid to humid regions with moderate to high seasonality. Our results suggest that several forest types are able to create a large storage to buffer for severe droughts (with a very long return period), in contrast to, for example, savannahs and woody savannahs (medium length return period), as well as grasslands, shrublands, and croplands (very short return period). The presented method to estimate root zone storage capacity eliminates the need for poor resolution soil and rooting depth data that form a limitation for achieving progress in the global land surface modelling community.",True,No,4.

Implementation of a Playful Microproject Based on Traditional Games for Working on Mathematical and Scientific Content,"According to previous research, we consider it necessary to extend the use of games, as mediating elements, in the learning of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) contents rejected by many students. For this, we have carried out an educational research project on games, with an ethnomathematical approach, since games are an important cultural sign with mathematical and scientific potentialities. We have prepared an anthropological study and an analytical one, generating a catalogue of games from different cultures. Thus, we have verified that, starting with culture, we can get to the game, but we posed the query as to whether, starting from certain games, we could achieve enculturation, by activating mathematical and scientific content in the players. To answer this query, we have created a curricular design called ""playful microproject"" with three traditional games from different cultures and geographical contexts. The microproject was implemented with 32 participants, from 8 to 12 years old. To analyse the results of the microproject, a case study was carried out using qualitative methodology. As part of the playful microproject, the necessary materials for each game were made by hand, and the games were then played. Both the realization of the games and the act of playing showed evidence of mathematical and scientific content, although more in the act of playing. The results revealed that: (1) the three games mobilized 21 categories of analysis, made up of scientific-mathematical content; (2) the three games proved to be equivalent in strong didactic potential; (3) that the microproject provides a valuable intercultural educational approach. The contents evidenced constitute a fundamental part of the Primary Education curriculum: classify, organize, measure, and quantify items, as well as formulate hypotheses, draw conclusions, place oneself in space, and design strategies, among others. It is concluded that these games can promote scientific-mathematical enculturation in a contextualized way.",True,No,4.

Innovating Industrial Design Curriculum in a Knowledge-Based and Participatory Digital Era,"This article narrates on three years participatory research between 2012 and 2014 and its formulation for a 2016 undergraduate industrial design curriculum launch. It contributes to design culture transformation since there are leading breakthrough education exemplars but lack of pathways to get there by conservative courses and institutions. The course proposes an individual and collective knowledge creation model through social constructivism and constructionism that recognises its place in time and history. It intends catching up with a profession transformed beyond a digital Bauhaus manifesto that bridges physical and digital artefacts, space and environments through quality of experiences, intelligence, networks and relations. Data and practice supported pedagogy redefinition from master-apprentice and teacher-centred skill transmission models to heutagogy and paragogy. The new approach required habitus change from a traditional goods-centred discipline to human-centred focus, critical design and making, design heuristics, CDIO (conceiving, designing, implementing, operating) and STEAM (science, technology, arts, mathematics) frameworks. Participants worked empathetically to contextualise, problem frame and solve by crossing boundaries between disciplines, institutions, industries, and students’ background and society. Research and practice promoted new forms of industrial design creation happening in physical and digital coexisting spaces of being. The curriculum expressed through units that evolved around an e-curriculum component working as a digital spine that progressed from standard social networking and industry collaboration to international design studio and design factory projects. It became foundation for future physical-digital industrial design artefacts, human computer interaction, machine learning, and systems built on hacker culture, shared information, free open-source software and hardware.",True,No,4.

Insights from bauhaus innovation for education and workplaces in a post-pandemic world,"This paper examines Bauhaus School (1919–1933) innovation and relevance today. The School is a landmark in the history of design as a discipline and the development of design education. The School was also a workplace, commercialising Bauhaus-designed products. While drawing global interest in its innovations, the School faced resistance in Germany because it challenged conventions. This problem raises the questions: How did the School-workplace generate innovations amid the calamity of post-war Germany, and what is the significance of the Bauhaus for post-pandemic education and workplaces one hundred years on? The concept of ‘transgression’ is used to understand innovation at the Bauhaus School-workplace. Haraway discusses transgressive practices that disrupt established knowledges, moving ways of thinking and doing in new directions. Analysis of workplace learning research reveals that three interfacing dimensions make up innovation: (1) workplace environments, (2) the culture-order that facilitates innovation, and (3) learning in practice in authentic settings. This qualitative case study reports on how Bauhaus innovation emerged at the intersection of these key dimensions. There are surprising commonalities between the Bauhaus approach to innovation in challenging times and contemporary thinking about supporting innovation which are relevant to education, particularly STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) education, and workplaces in a world affected by the COVID 19 pandemic. Thus, encouraging people who challenge boundaries, rules or ‘the way things are’ can support innovation. This paper addresses a gap in workplace learning research on interrelated dimensions of innovation which the Bauhaus recognized.

Is There Deep Learning on Mars? STEAM Education in an Inquiry-Based Out-of-School Setting,"Learning intervention based on a ""Mars and Space"" exhibition was designed according to STEAM-education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) principles and practices in order to bridge the gap between formal and informal learning. The cognitive learning of 12-year-old students in Finland (""N"" = 306) showed a sustained level for a six months period. The results of this study provided evidence that situational motivation was enhanced by interest in school science in the STEAM science exhibition context. This led to better cognitive learning results in the post-knowledge test. Thus, interest and situational motivation were the first steps, and the superficial situational motivation seemed to successfully change into content-based intrinsic motivation with longer-lasting, deep learning outcomes. STEAM intervention apparently produced long-term learning, and this exhibition learning setting is shown to provide an appropriate platform to reach the deeper layers to successfully retain knowledge. Boys' scores rose even in the delayed test. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) to assess the effects on individual, motivational and situational interest in learning, situation motivation is shown to work as a catalyst and acting as a catalyst and also acted as a stepping stone for intrinsic motivation as part of relative autonomy (RAI) and a deep learning strategy.",True,No,4.

Library and Student Innovation Center: Makerspace!,"The College of Engineering and Applied Science together with the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Education, and the UW Libraries developed a Library/Student Innovation Center (LIC/SIC), Makerspace, to spark student innovation, creativity, and design skills. In May 2012, Governor Mead, the State legislature, and the Wyoming Governor’s Energy, Engineering, STEM Integration Taskforce articulated a vision to propel the College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS) and the University of Wyoming to the realms of excellence in instruction, research, and service.” Part of this initiative included active learning “Makerspace” in the new Engineering Education and Research Building (EERB). Makerspace employs technology along with hands-on education to spark student innovation, creativity, design and entrepreneurship. The UW Libraries has graciously provided 2500 square feet of space to develop a prototype Library Innovation Center during the Fall 2016 semester. Lessons learned and equipment purchased will form the basis of the Student Innovation Center planned for the EERB. Ground breaking for the EERB was October 7, 2016 with a scheduled completion of Spring 2019. The goal of the LIC/SIC is to provide experiential learning space for STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) students. The LIC/SIC provides a location for students to explore ideas, complete class projects, or pursue an entrepreneurial innovation. Also, the space is available to conduct classes and workshops. The space is coordinated and managed by an onsite specialist. The Library/Student Innovation Center planning team consists of an interdisciplinary group of faculty members and students with a common interest – hands on, innovative learning. In this paper we provide detailed information in developing a Makerspace including equipment selection, staffing, funding, day-to-day operations and lessons learned. This paper serves as a useful guide for other institutions considering standing up a makerspace.",True,No,4.

Live Contact with the International Space Station from School,"The Royal Masonic School for Girls made history in February 2016 when it became the first school to establish a video link with the International Space Station via amateur radio--the result of a competition run by ARISS. Six girls from year 9 (age 13-14 years) qualified for Foundation Amateur Radio Licences, and students across the school took part in space-related activities during the buildup to the link-up. During the 10 minute link-up, made possible by the ARISS UK Operations team, students could see Tim on a big screen and asked him prepared questions covering space activities and careers; the event was also streamed live. This unique event provided considerable insight into ""physics in action"" and visits by speakers from the European Space Agency, defence, aerospace and security agency QinetiQ, Airbus, and a former student now at the UK Space Agency, have enthused our students about science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) careers.",True,No,4.

Low-Cost Astrophotography with a Smartphone: STEAM in Action,"Astrophotography has been responsible for the discovery of planets, solar systems, stars, and several other celestial objects, which directly helps with expanding our knowledge about the universe and creating scientific models for nature. Practical techniques have been extensively described, including Covington, who has published an extensive guide to amateur astrophotography. Furthermore, aiming to introduce such important scientific activity among students, several authors have described possibilities of using the technique in physics and astronomy teaching. However, the proposed activities and methods normally need expensive equipment, such as telescopes, professional cameras, mounts, tripods, optical components, and other items not commonly owned by teachers, students, or the general public. The ubiquity of the smartphone, especially among students, makes it interesting for educational purposes. The device can be used as a mobile laboratory due to the several integrated sensors. Furthermore, the possible uses in classroom are extensive, including the ones involving astronomical subjects, especially with the use of its camera for sky imaging. In this work, we propose a simple and low-cost technique for the practice of astrophotography using the smartphone. Moreover, we suggest teaching activities involving the STEAM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math), including the analysis of the Earth's rotation and the artistic treatment of the astrophotographs.",True,No,4.

"Making on the Move: Mobility, Makerspaces, and Art Education","Combining the excitement from the maker movement and the novel creation of deployable makerspaces, we review the development of the Mobile Atelier for Kinaesthetic Education (MAKE) 3D. MAKE 3D is a mobile makerspace platform that can be deployed anywhere there is electricity to create a curricular spectacle of digital fabrication in particular additive manufacturing or what is more commonly referred to as 3D printing. Our project combines this notion of curricular spectacle and a mobile makerspace platform, to develop strategies in how to meet the novice user almost anywhere and to entice them into a series of hands-on activities that would give them a range of knowledge and aptitude for additive techniques in digital fabrication. We review the component parts of our Material to Form curriculum and explore thematic connections between the maker movement and art education including STEAM and interdisciplinarity; design thinking and kinaesthetic learning; and place-based education and the mobile platform. Informal practices in art education and the mobile makerspace advances forms of place and kinaesthetic learning. Similar curricular setups are therefore encouraged to reinforce and expand prior knowledge, broaden participation and provide an adaptable learning space for STEAM initiatives.",True,No,4.

Making Space: Teacher Perceptions of How Participation and Choice Are Mediated within Maker Education in Independent Schools,"While previous research of maker spaces has primarily been focused on public and community spaces, this dissertation looked at maker education in independent schools. Maker education often challenges traditional approaches to teaching and learning, positioning teachers more as facilitators who support students to make meaningful decisions as they realize their big ideas. In examining whether maker education is one way for independent schools to create more inclusive educational settings, this dissertation paid close attention to the pedagogical moves of maker education teachers. In order to conceptualize the power dynamics that influence the teaching and learning within maker education, this study used the construct of third space to explore pedagogical forms of power. Choice and participation are both factors that influence where power lies in a classroom. To better understand the mediating factors of choice and participation, this study used a qualitative approach to examine 17 different teachers’ perceptions of choice and participation within maker education in independent schools. This study also explored how the limitations of COVID-19 impacted the work maker education teachers did with their students. An analysis of the interviews explored how maker teachers’ practices and pedagogical moves make space for student choice and agency. The findings revealed that teacher autonomy enabled the teachers to lift up multiple ways of knowing and gave them a freedom from assigning grades, allowing them to rethink how students were assessed. The teachers’ perceptions of their approach to teaching also appeared aligned with several culturally responsive teaching (CRT) practices, positioning maker education with the potential to renegotiate what is considered legitimate knowledge and providing independent schools with one way to create more inclusive settings. An analysis of findings related to the impacts of COVID-19 revealed that teachers were able to identify several opportunities as a result of COVID-19 limitations. Having fewer materials available proved to be beneficial, time became more expansive. and students’ learning was better connected to their home-based experience. The experiences that maker education teachers described facilitating during COVID-19 present the option to do things differently when students return to in-person learning.",True,No,4.

Optimization of Steam Distillation Process and Chemical Constituents of Volatile Oil from <i>Angelicae</i> <i>sinensis</i> Radix,"In this study, the steam distillation process of volatile oil from Angelicae sinensis Radix was optimized according to the concept of quality-by-design. A homemade glass volatile oil extractor was used to achieve better cooling of the volatile oil. First, the soaking time, distillation time, and liquid–material ratio were identified as potential critical process parameters by consulting the literature. Then, the three parameters were investigated by single factor experiments. The volatile oil yield increased with the extension in the distillation time, and first increased and then decreased with the increase in soaking time and liquid–material ratio. The results confirmed that soaking time, distillation time, and liquid–material ratio were all critical process parameters. The kinetics models of volatile oil distillation from Angelicae sinensis Radix were established. The diffusion model of spherical particle was found to be the best model and indicated that the major resistance of mass transfer was the diffusion of volatile oil from the inside to the surface of the medicinal herb. Furthermore, the Box–Behnken experimental design was used to study the relationship between the three parameters and volatile oil yield. A second-order polynomial model was established, with R2 exceeding 0.99. The design space of the volatile oil yield was calculated by a probability-based method. In the verification experiments, the average volatile oil yield reached 0.711%. The results showed that the model was accurate and the design space was reliable. In this study, 21 chemical constituents of volatile oil from Angelicae sinensis Radix were identified by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer(GC-MS), accounting for 99.4% of the total volatile oil. It was found that the content of Z-ligustilide was the highest, accounting for 85.4%.",True,No,4.

"RISING Strong: Sustainability through Art, Science, and Collective Community Action","The objective of this research is to offer a qualitative analysis of adult STEAM (science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics) learning in a community setting, with a focus on sustainability and climate action. To date, much research on STEAM learning has been directed towards youth and children in formal educational settings. Our qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with community participants, artists, and scientists over the course of a six-month initiative in Ireland allowed us to develop a rich picture of a multi-faceted STEAM project that held space for both a social change agenda and a learning agenda. In our findings, we identified several contributing factors to transformative learning and changed feelings about climate change, including pride of place, the development of strong interpersonal relationships, and an emerging sense of collective agency through a shared emotional and affective journey. To design for meaningful, community-level climate action, we argue that learning may be supported in, with and through STEAM. Our study also showcases the value of the arts and aesthetic experiences to embrace dissensus when tackling a complex issue like climate change through STEAM education.",True,No,4.

"Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math (STEAM) Diplomacy: Preliminary Results from an Initial Pilot Course","The emergent, interdisciplinary topic of “Science Diplomacy” includes: 1) training scientists to serve as diplomats (i.e., integrating the ‘art’ of political science into the STEM disciplines to create STEAM – science, technology, engineering, art, and math), 2) empowering countries to collaborate on scientific advancement through diplomacy (i.e., CERN and the international space station), and 3) building cross-cultural relationships among scientists from different countries (i.e., Fulbright exchange in STEM disciplines). Because science diplomacy occurs at the nexus of diverse disciplines, it is simultaneously difficult for a single individual to learn the full range of topics necessary to offer such a course, and it is structurally problematic for two or more faculty from diverse academic departments (often in different colleges) to co-teach such a course (i.e., cross listing a course among a Department of Engineering and a Department of Political Science can be a challenge). Nonetheless, training students in Science Diplomacy is critically important to – inter alia – manage the global environment (i.e., polar regions, oceans, transnational freshwater, biodiversity, and atmospheric quality), to protect global health (i.e., biodefense, pandemics, and emergent infections), and to share human-made technological ecosystems (i.e., infrastructure, energy production, outer space, and the internet). Recognizing the need to bridge science and diplomacy, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) created the Center for Science Diplomacy, launched the quarterly publication, Science &amp; Diplomacy, and has begun to offer short courses and research gatherings. A very limited number of institutions have also begun to offer courses on “Science Diplomacy” – Tufts, Columbia, and NYU – and some institutions are creating MOOCs in science diplomacy – SUNY has a MOOC with a specialization in global health diplomacy. Recently, a monograph originally prepared in French was translated into English and is being marketed by Springer as a ‘text book’ for Science Diplomacy instruction. Through a Presidential initiative at our university, a new course, cross-listed between the a Department of Engineering and a Department of Political Science has been developed. The course consists of three major cognitive (knowledge) activities, including: 1) students complete low-level Bloom’s taxonomy learning (i.e., recall) through listening to pre-recorded lectures, reviewing assigned reading, and completing low-stakes, frequent online quizzes (i.e., a flipped classroom); 2) students complete high-level Bloom’s taxonomy learning (i.e., creation) through the preparation of two, term-length written documents, namely: a) the construction of a new, comprehensive case study of science diplomacy on a topic selected by the student and approved by the instructor; and b) an application for a science diplomacy fellowship/internship/scholarship (i.e., term-length inductive learning); and 3) students complete mid-level Bloom’s taxonomy learning (i.e., analysis) through completing five, one-page, essays in response to existing case studies (i.e., rubric-based grading of essays). To accommodate the diverse learning styles and preferred means of assessment for a diverse student population across multiple disciplines, course grading also includes asynchronous, regular participation in an online discussion board (i.e., course participation), a written midterm, and a written final exam all aimed at low and mid-level Bloom’s taxonomy learning. A ‘buffet approach’ is used to assign final grades with students completing a sub-set of available assignments providing ample opportunities for each student to demonstrate ‘excellence’ (i.e., ‘A’) in learning the cognitive content. To supplement the cognitive (knowledge) content, learning in the affective (attitude) domain is achieved through online journaling with self-assessment, peer feedback, and instructor evaluation. Code-word searches are used to document personal growth in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Learning in the psychomotor (skills) domain is achieved through mock negotiations among teams of students employing a Model United Nations activity. This article will present the format of the course and the results of evaluation of a pilot offering.",True,No,4.

Scientists for Tomorrow - A Self-Sustained Initiative to Promote STEM in Out-of-School Time Frameworks in Under-served Community-Based Organizations: Evaluation and Lessons Learned,"On 2011, the Scientists for Tomorrow (SfT) Initiative started with the support of an NSF-ISE grant for a period of two years serving 15 sites. Today the initiative is in its sixth year, serving more than 40 community based organizations (CBOs) sites, 600 middle school student and 150 parents per semester in a self-sustained mode. The SfT initiative is designed to provide urban youth in Chicago with information and skills related to science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers and foster positive attitudes toward Stem subjects and related careers. Given that the initiative is hosted in the Department of Science and Mathematics – Columbia College Chicago, an art and media school, the contents promoted in the communities include also an Art component, changing from STEM to STEAM. The initiative is a partnership between a higher education institutions, local community based organizations (CBO’s) and local Informal Science Education providers. In the original design, the implementation of the program in the communities during the academic year, was divided into 3 sessions of 10 weeks: Fall (October-December); Winter (January- March) and Spring (April – June). Each session explores a different module such as Alternative Energies, Physics of Sound and Mathematics of Music, People and Plants, Robotics or Astronomy. Before each session starts, SfT provides more than 15 hours of professional development for all of the instructors involved in the program (staff members from the CBO’s, grad and undergrad students). Each session includes 10 meetings (once per week) of 90 minutes with an end of the module showcase the last session. At the end of each module, all of the CBO’s sites participate in a Family Science Day in one of the ISE venues partners: Museum of Science and Industry (December), Field Museum (March), and Garfield Conservatory (June). The question the initiative explores is if there are changes in participants’ and CBOs leadership attitude towards STEAM and gain of content knowledge. For this effect, participants are given a pre and post attitude test for each module per session, in order to determine their knowledge and awareness towards STEM. These tests are scored through an external evaluator and provide quality information for how to modify curriculum in the future. Additionally, all instructors are required to complete Activity Journal Logs after each of their class sessions. These internal evaluations allow instructors to reflect on their formative assessment techniques, as well as find where they needed more support. Leadership within the program reads the logs daily and reacts accordingly, providing all necessary resources. Finally, the Community Site Director, Coordinators and Volunteers are given a survey to evaluate the program as a whole, at the end of each module. These are internally analyzed to find effective improve the partnership as well as their STEAM afterschool program. The result of the four years external evaluation (two years of the grants and two years no-cost extension) shows that the initiative has a significant positive impact in the attitude toward STEM of the participants as well as in their gain of content knowledge. Also shows a significant positive change of attitude from the CBO’s leadership toward the introduction of STEAM academic enrichment activities as part of the regular activities in their OST programs. Some of the learned lessons include 1) the need to have more parental involvement in the OST activities of their children to ensure the success of the initiative, 2) have a flexible professional development and instructors follow up strategy to ensure the quality of the learning process and the growth of the CBOs capacity to continue promoting STEAM as an integral part of their OST educational offer, and 3) the need to promote the public perception that OST learning is important as formal education to promote the children, especially in under-served communities.",True,No,4.

STEAM: Choreographing the Phases of the Moon,"STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) lessons have leaned heavily on the visual arts in interdisciplinary preservice learning. For preservice teachers, the application of STEAM pedagogies encourages complexity of thought connecting with their past and new experiences as well as greater self-awareness and risk-taking. Preservice teachers and elementary school students are introduced into the communicative and dynamic power of the arts through creative interdisciplinary teamwork in STEAM lessons. To enhance the impact of arts integration, dance/movement has the potential to add a kinetic connection to the study of the changing phases of the moon. Neuroscientists have begun to focus on physical movement as a means to demystify how the brain coordinates with the body to perform complex precise movements that express emotion and convey meaning (Hanna 2015). Choreographing movement most closely mirrors the actual progressive changes of the appearance of the moon in the night sky. This article describes a K-6 preservice course in which the content and activities included dance/movement and the making of visual art as props to teach about the eight phases of the moon over the course of a month combined with the nightly journey of the moon across the sky.",True,No,4.

Students' Planetarium,"Our students built a full-size, mobile planetarium in three weeks. The planetarium was built with commonly available, cheap construction materials. Our priorities were mobility, possibility of quick assembly and reassembly and the students' availability of materials in every place in the world. The students calculated all the parameters of the planetarium's construction themselves, chose materials of appropriate technical parameters, built the planetarium's framework, elaborated the methods of projections and sounding. Taking into consideration the spectators' comfort they also designed systems of air conditioning and cooling. The project is completely consistent with the STEM and even the STEAM method. The artistic factor of the students' work was revealed during the visualisation of planetarium projections and its adornment. The final product of their work is a functional planetarium and a manual for its construction.",True,No,4.

Teaching the Concept of Time: A STEAM-Based Program on Computational Thinking in Science Education,"The aim of this research was to develop a STEAM-based program for teaching middle school students the concept of time to enhance their computational thinking skills. The proposed Time Teaching Program (TTP) consists of modules and activities on the definition of time, historical development of time measurement tools, universal time measurement system, space--time theory, and time as a fourth dimension. To determine the effectiveness of TTP and its effect on middle school students' computational thinking skills, a mixed methodology was adopted in which both a quasi-experimental design including a pretest-posttest control group and an observational case study were used concurrently. The study group consisted of eighth-grade students from a public middle school in Turkey, selected according to the convenient sampling method. A computational thinking test was used to collect quantitative data, and observations and semi-structured interviews were utilized for the collection of qualitative data. According to the results of analyses, when the effects of the pretest scores were not considered, there was a significant difference (F[subscript 0.469], 1, R[superscript 2] = 0.518) between the final test scores of the experimental and control groups in favor of the former.

The Culture of Disciplines: Reconceptualising Multi-Subject Curricula,"The arts are recognised for their potential to humanise and enrich educational experience, but hold a lowly position in the hierarchy of school subject-based curricula. This limits the time, and thus the influence, they can have. Whilst schools welcome the idea of a curriculum rich with both arts and science subjects, resistance to realising this is often advanced in terms of the proportion of curriculum time required for different subjects. Arguments for STEAM education, whilst apparently challenging this and valuing the potential of the arts, have reinforced its servant role. Drawing on research into a particular project, where the perspectives of the arts and sciences inform and enrich how the other is experienced and understood, we reframe this problem. Firstly, drawing on Massey's conception of space-time, we argue that one can conceive of more than one subject occupying the same curricular space on a school timetable. Secondly, informed by Geertz, we consider what the culture of the arts and the sciences offers, suggesting that this appears to reflect what teachers have valued. We argue that foregrounding the culture of school subjects, and particularly the culture of the arts, as part of a multicultural frame can facilitate rich and engaging educational experiences. Rather than being positioned as competing for time or status in the curriculum, a focus on culture emphasises how the co-existence and interplay of multiple subjects broadens, develops and thus enriches children's educational experience. It also enables a different conception of, and thus role for, the arts in schooling.",True,No,4.

The Emerging Critical Pedagogies of Dance Educators in an Urban STEAM After-School Program for Black Girls,"The preparation of urban educators has gained widespread attention across education policy, research, and practice. As US urban cities have become more diverse, the teacher workforce has not kept up, and the racial/ethnic demographics of students and teachers are disproportionately incongruent. In order to eradicate an education landscape that perpetuates white, middle-class ways of knowing and being, often at the expense of the cultural practices and cultural wealth of historically marginalized students of color, urban teacher education must be centered toward justice and rooted in critical pedagogies. The literature, albeit bleak, reveals that these perspectives must also be applied to urban dance education. Dance education programs have been significantly eliminated from urban schools over time, and although dance has historical roots in African and African diasporic cultures, dance education continues to be Eurocentric. This phenomenological case study examines the emerging critical pedagogies of undergraduate dance majors and minors who served as dance teachers in an urban Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) after-school program for 7-12-year-old Black girls. Findings reveal that (a) navigating race, place, and space; (b) mentorship and practice; and (c) critical reflection and self-efficacy were critical components of the urban dance educators' emerging critical pedagogies. Implications for urban dance education and the broader field of urban education are provided.",True,No,4.

The implementation results of safe bicycle transport in Taipei City,"Background: In 2013, there were 7,016 bicycle accidents, resulting in 62 deaths and 10,162 injuries in Taiwan. Since then, there have been more than 7,000 accidents every year, and the number of accidents in 2017 has reached a peak of 8,106 records for the past five years. Among them, the number of electric bicycle accidents increased the most, with 1,183 compared to 2013 and the number of persons injured also increased by 1,310 whereas the number of bicycle accident from 6,262 to 6,169. Methods: Taipei City creating a friendly, safe and secure urban environment to ride: 1. Bicycle Road Network Deployment: bicycle-exclusive lanes, walkways, bicycle and pedestrian shared path and so on in order to meet a variety of traffic needs. 2. Safe and comprehensive road environment: Set up bike stands, road surfacing, street trees, signs, (pavement) markings, dedicated signs, intersection rotation and other traffic amenities to create a safe and comfortable riding environment. To promote cycling to the station to transfer MRTs is tantamount to encouraging people to take more public transport. 3. Planning a city bicycle rental system: To provide a public rental system to expand the convenience, visibility and the community of users launched a new type of public transport - public bicycle rental system (YouBike). The Youbike started demonstration operation, initially setting up 11 station points and 500 bicycles in the peripheral regions of Xinyi District on March 1 1th, 2009, and now there are 400 station points in all districts. 4. Bicycle Safe Riding Education: Most people refuse to wear helmet protection, and do not install safety devices such as reflectors and warning lights. Causes easy collision at night. The top three reasons for bicycle accidents are not giving way according to regulations, inappropriately making U-turns (turn direction) and Breaching traffic signs and sign controls. Furthermore, wrong-way driving and Careless overstepping are also the main causes of accidents. 5. Smart transportation Setting: To build a safe environment from the appropriate space. Its city area cycle path from 41 kilometers in 2006 (16.4 for dedicated lanes and 24.6 for bicycle and pedestrian shared path) to an extended 391 kilometers in 2018 (86.7 kilometers for dedicated lanes and 304.3 for bicycle and pedestrian shared path). The number of bike stands in Taipei urban area has increased from 5,202 in 2006 to 42,121 in 2018(809%). Appropriately adjust the lane allocation ratio through management means and let the left-turning bicycle turn in a two-stage left turn. This way allows the bicycle to start earlier than the steam locomotive when the green light starts to light up. Results: The implementation results of safe bicycle transport in Taipei City effectively reduced the death and rate caused by head injuries in bicycle accidents: the number of casualties (6,262 dropped to 6,169, down 1.49%), the number of deaths (59 to 30, a drop of 49.15%) or the number of injured persons (9,099 to 8,71 1), all presented a declining trend. Conclusion: Changing car-oriented road planning, complete bicycle infrastructure, and respecting the driving awareness of bicycle users is the best protection for the public. All policies should have comprehensive safety policies to ensure personal safety. Just like separate two types of transport, the overall design of the exclusive separation bicycle road, the policy of forcing all ages riding locomotives to wear helmets, etc. In the future, we will continue to plan for self-defense special road layout, intersection ramp configuration, traffic engineering and parking and transfer facilities, so that all roads in the city are safe and friendly, and we will become the first place for bicycle safety riding. Successful experience is extended to the whole country.",True,No,4.

The potential of citizen science data to complement satellite and airborne lidar tree height measurements: lessons from The GLOBE Program,"The Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program is an international science, citizen science, and education program through which volunteers in participating countries collect environmental data in support of Earth system science. Using the program’s software application, GLOBE Observer (GO), volunteers measure tree height and optional tree circumference, which may support the interpretation of NASA and other space-based satellite data such as tree height data from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation instrument. This paper describes tree heights data collected through the GO application and identifies sources of error in data collection. We also illustrate how the ground-based citizen science data collected in the GO application can be used in conjunction with ICESat-2 tree height observations from two locations in the United States: Grand Mesa, Colorado, and Greenbelt, Maryland. Initial analyses indicate that data location accuracy and the scientific relevance of data density should be considered in order to align GLOBE tree height data with satellite-based data collections. These recommendations are intended to inform the improved implementation of citizen science environmental data collection in scientific work and to document a use case of the GLOBE Trees data for the science research community.",True,No,4.

The initial phase of theproject to demonstrate the production of biodiesel using waste vegetable oil (WVO) from campusdining services has been successfully executed by UMES student team. Under the supervision ofthe project leaders, the students have worked in teams to collect, dewater, and filter the WVO;supported the acquisition of supplies and installation of the biodiesel processor; performednecessary titration and laboratory tests on the WVO to determine appropriate amounts ofchemicals ( sodium hydroxide, methanol, and sulfuric acid) to be used with a batch of WVO inthe processor for the esterification and transesterification reactions; and operated and monitoredthe 48 hour biodiesel production and washing cycle of the processor. Besides biodiesel theprocess produces glycerin as byproduct. The glycerin has been used to produce soap successfullyby the students. Students have also tested ‘gelling’ tendency of different blends of biodiesel andare currently working with the UMES farm manager to identify and appropriately modify farmequipment for biodiesel use. Students are also working with the university safety office to refinesafety considerations to comply with OSHA and municipality requirements. Students will beinvolved in managing broader logistics of scheduling the processor operation for biodieselproduction and utilization, based on needs of the farm equipment. The project team plans torefine the processing of glycerin by-product to improve the aesthetics, fragrance, and otherqualitative parameters of the soap so that they may sell it for possible fund-raising efforts forselected student organizations.The project leaders have encouraged all “STEAM” (science, technology, engineering, agriculture,and mathematics) majors to participate in the ongoing efforts and are exploring involvement ofinterested business, human ecology, and fine-arts students to address some of the new dimensionsof the project. Maryland Space Grant Consortium has provided supplementary support forinterested undergraduate students, particularly from the underserved population to get involved.The broader scope of the project includes use of biodiesel, a carbon neutral energy source, for usewith farm equipment and as an alternative transportation fuel to address climate change andsustainable energy related issues. Furthermore, the project will continue to address use of remotesensing and advanced geospatial information technology tools to optimize use of nutrients, water,and other resources for efficient production agriculture practices that are critical to provide foodfor a growing population on the planet in a sustainable fashion.",True,No,4.

Visual Frictions,"The predominant approach in visual studies, explicitly focusing on how vision is socioculturally constructed, tends to neglect the physiological substrate for vision. Images, and our visual surroundings, are often considered from the premise that those dealing with them specifically see with average eyesight and that differences in seeing can be accounted for by cultural and ideological analyses. I set out to question this premise and the normalisation of vision it implies, by drawing on accounts of seeing by Conrad, a friend and colleague who sees with special requirements. His well-articulated verbal description of the requirements involved in his seeing makes it clear that our vision is tightly intertwined with visuality. Our visual surroundings are the way they are partially on account of the ability to see implied. As Conrad puts it, ""they are designed for average eyesight."" I posit that the concept of activated affordances is useful for taking into account that vision is socially constructed, as suggested in important works in visual studies, and that physiological substrates for vision exhibit variation. I will focus particularly on how the designed environment becomes an area for Conrad in which visuality is lived out differently in accordance with how this eyesight happens to manifest itself. Conrad's use of ""social hacks"" provides a case in point for discussing how Conrad activates affordances in unforeseen ways, in order to fulfil desires for socially meaningful action that does not reduce him to stereotypical behaviour when being treated as visually impaired. Maintaining that vision and visuality remain difficult to disentangle, I will argue that we all see with special requirements, even if we might not notice this. For studies of visuality, I suggest reflecting on presumed understandings of vision. The argument in textual form is complemented with a brief video that features an edited interview focusing on Conrad's account of seeing with special requirements. It is supported with visualisations representing an attempt to render aspects of his seeing. Instead of purporting to visualise exactly how he sees, I intend the imagery to provoke reflection of seeing as a complex process, mediated via our ability to see and by the social construction of what to see. 28228_UF0001.jpg Dr. Asko Lehmuskallio is a researcher at the School of Communication, Media and Theatre at the University of Tampere and at Locating Media at the University of Siegen.

Studies both of images and of our visual surroundings often proceed from an implicit premise that those dealing with them see with average eyesight and that differences in seeing can be accounted for by cultural and ideological analyses. Here, I question this premise and the normalisation of vision implied, by drawing on accounts of seeing offered by Conrad, a friend and colleague who sees with special requirements. As his eloquent verbalisation of the requirements for seeing makes clear, our vision is closely intertwined with visuality.1 In part, our visual surroundings are the way they are because of the ability to see implied. As Conrad puts it, ""they are designed for average eyesight."" In the discussion that follows, I will focus particularly on how the designed environment becomes an area where visuality is lived out differently depending on the kind of eyesight one happens to have. I wish to argue that we all see with special requirements, and that our requirements linked to seeing differ, depending on our physiological substrate for vision. When attending to designed environments, we situationally adapt to prescribed ways of seeing that are culturally and ideologically formed. I suggest that the concept of activated affordances is helpful for taking into account both the physiological substrate for vision needed for seeing and the cultural and ideological formations that suggest which affordances get activated instead of others.2 The argument in textual form is complemented by a brief video that includes an edited interview focusing on an account of seeing with special requirements. The interview is supported with visualisations intended to render aspects of Conrad's seeing. Instead of claiming to visualise exactly how Conrad sees, I use the imagery to stimulate reflection of seeing as a complex process, mediated via both our ability to see and the social construction of what to see.3 A PARADOX IN VISUAL STUDIES: THE NORMALISATION OF VISION In a well-regarded preface to an edited work on vision and visuality, Hal Foster explains how scopic regimes seek to essentialise vision, naturalising and normalising a certain way to see. He maintains that although vision is based on physiological processes, it is also very much culturally and socially informed. Sight and its techniques intertwine in ways that make them difficult to disentangle, whereas vision and visuality remain woven together.4 Much of the important and influential work published in visual culture studies tends to focus on the latter, the social construction of practices related to vision and visuality, emphasising ways in which power structures, visual orders, scopic regimes, and various gazes direct our attention, our ways of looking, and the meanings that we give to what we see. In doing so, they situate observers, subjects, or bodies within nuanced patterns of power-laden and structured visual interactions.5 These studies explicitly work with the social construction of vision and constitute attempts to uncover asymmetric power structures and to counter them. While doing so, much of this work takes implicitly a particular physiological substrate of vision for granted, although influential figures such as Foster or Mitchell warn against doing so.6 In many of these studies, pictures and the mental images they occasion are deemed so powerful because people can see them. Studies on visual culture seldom reflect from this perspective the premises behind their work; paradoxically, it seems that much of the work explicitly questioning a normalised visuality as socially constructed normalises the physiological substrate of vision.7 I suggest that the concept of activated affordances is useful for understanding the intertwinement of vision and visuality, of how bodies and their environments merge within seeing, helping to point both towards affordances as a relation needed for seeing in the first place and to their activation as a particular cultural form of attention and meaning-making. James J. Gibson coined the term affordance to discuss the complementarity of animals and persons with their environments.8 Affordances, in Gibson's understanding, always describe relations between living beings and their particular environments, and these relations depend both on the living beings and on the environments in question. For example, a small mobile phone screen is perceivable, readable, and therefore usable for text messaging by those with sufficiently good eyesight (for perception and reading) and adequate motor skills (for texting) but not, for example, by many elderly individuals with poor eyesight. The latter can perceive the mobile phone's screen but, because of both poor eyesight and the limited screen size, cannot read it. The mobile phone does not afford them the same kinds of uses it affords others. Gibson's use of the notion of affordance is of assistance for pointing towards the relationality and variety of affordances, but he does not give culturally sensitive explanations addressing why some affordances are preferred over others. For accounting for cultural contextualisations, it is useful to think of activated affordances if one wishes to comprehend the actual use of particular objects, and how their use is embedded in social meanings, as Gillian Rose has proposed in her work on everyday photography.9 The focus on the activation of affordances is useful for pointing to culturally meaningful ways of interacting in visual environments. In Conrad's case, as will be shown later, there is, for example, an explicit activation of coarse-level visual features of friends and colleagues for purposes of identifying them (among these are hair type/style, colour of clothing, and ways of walking), because this kind of activation of affordances is socially meaningful. Being able to identify someone as an individual person is very much encouraged, at least in the so-called Western societies, and, for doing so, some affordances have to be activated rather than others. The affordances available depend, again, not only on the social construction of seeing but also, just as much, on the particular ways in which we are able to see. Conrad's account of the visual frictions encountered in his everyday life is useful for a discussion on how the affordances activated depend both on socially meaningful action and on the physical opportunities for action available to each of us. Mitchell has importantly pointed out that ""[i]t is not just that we see the way we do because we are social animals, but also that our social arrangements take the forms they do because we are seeing animals.""10 Unfortunately for those seeing with special requirements, many social environments continue to be designed with average eyesight in mind. SEEING WITH SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS Conrad provides a good example for a discussion on this possible normalisation of vision and the way in which it rests on particular assumptions about visualities, especially regarding designed environments. Many do not necessarily recognise that Conrad is visually impaired, because he tends to act and talk in ways that do not distinguish him from most others. Although he wears thick eyeglasses, it is not clear to many people that he actually sees very differently than many others do. Whereas he is thus able to ""blend in"" in diverse situations, he does so by activating other affordances than most people with average eyesight do. Where this possibility is not available, he finds that many have a hard time even believing him to need help when he expresses this need. I have many situations in which people don't really realize how much I see, because I have so many tricks, and I hack myself through life somehow. So a lot of times when I tell them I am visually impaired, they sort of don't believe me, and that is a really big problem for me when I try to achieve accessibility or equal behavior, or something like that.11 Conrad has created social hacks, particular activations of affordances that enable him to interact such that his special requirements in seeing are not that readily noticed. These social hacks provide him with a way of rendering his behaviour in front of others so that his actions are not constrained beforehand for reason of his vision. When acting as yet another person who sees as everyone else does, and thereby as someone who is able to navigate built environments and social situations as those with average eyesight do, Conrad allows himself to be drawn into situations that he might not enter if others made judgements in keeping with his impairments in vision. Conrad would not differ from most other people if his visual system were more commonplace. His use of the concept of seeing with special requirements implies that all human beings have particular requirements for their sensory perception and action upon the environment, and that these requirements differ from person to person, just as Gibson suggests with the notion of affordance. As the examples Conrad cites from his life experience make clear, many designed environments are geared towards those with average eyesight, disrupting their use by people with different visual systems. Even everyday utility articles and artefacts such as computers, houses, or cars are often designed for people with normalised, average vision. Conrad points out: [I]f they would be just slightly changed in their designs to meet my requirements, I wouldn't have so many problems actually getting around in the world. If I use the term 'people with special requirements', it always implies that it's not my fault that I can't do this thing at the moment or can't operate this machine or that it takes much longer, but it's actually the fault of the design, because [the problematic element or item] wasn't designed for my requirements but was designed for someone else's requirements. Here, vision and visuality intertwine in ways that show how a variety of designed environments rely on an assumption of average eyesight, a necessary condition for taking up a relation, an affordance, in the first place. Thus, designed artefacts are socially constructed to fit the requirements of particular kinds of people.12 Slight changes in designed environments could enable a better fit between Conrad's body and the material artefacts around him, but designed environments tend to be oriented towards normalised vision rather than allowing for other kinds of activations, such as Conrad's social hacks discussed below.13 Whereas, as Gibson suggests, these differences between individuals may vary significantly, too often there is the tendency to think in discreet binaries, such as normal and special, leading to design decisions that do not take variety into account.14 Acknowledging we all have special requirements in seeing is helpful for deconstructing this binary opposition. FLUID BOUNDARIES OF THE BODY We need a particular physiological substrate for vision if we are to act in environments designed for average eyesight.15 Perhaps, because of the need to adapt to these environments in order to participate in the diverse social interactions presented, devices that allow eyesight that is closer to average eyesight can be felt to be almost as necessary as parts of the body, as is the case with Conrad. Devices modifying our bodies can afford seeing and acting in environments designed for average eyesight: One's body has to be moulded if it is to fit these designed environments. Conrad makes this relation explicit by stating that ""my glasses are not really an object for me; they are more a part of my body like an arm or something like that."" His eyeglasses enable him to partake in meaningful social relations, to activate affordances he would not be able to activate without them. The boundaries of his body are described as not neatly contained but, rather, fluid, such that some material artefacts can be felt to be, in essence, body parts, not that different from an arm or fingers, for example. This understanding provides an example suitable for advancing the thesis of relationality of affordances, particularly addressing how the designed environments we act upon might mould and modify both our bodies and our understandings of them. This fluidity of bodily boundaries becomes understandable when the role of our bodies as a medium for action is underscored, as done in theories of media put forth by John Durham Peters and Hans Belting, among others.16 Our bodies, once moulded, afford novel relations to our environments, a novel fit, and this novel fit might be achieved through glasses, mobile phones, and/or other kinds of artefacts, effectively enabling the distribution and mediation of our selves.17 Action in environments designed for the requirements of average eyesight necessitates media that facilitate it. For some, the physical body itself provides a sufficient medium for doing so, being capable of adapting to the requirements of average eyesight in various environments; however, ever more people need specially fabricated eyewear in order to achieve fit with their environments. There is constant need for spectacles, contact lenses, and other media for being able to see in environments designed for average eyesight. SOCIAL HACKS Although Conrad's glasses feel more like a part of the body for him, he continues to see differently than those who by wearing spectacles approximate normal vision. When using eyeglasses, he must still rely on more prominent features of the people and objects he perceives, thereby explicitly activating affordances that he can rely upon in order to act in a socially meaningful way. Normally, I can't recognise people by their face when they are decently far away, so I use a lot of rough features, like what their body structure looks like, what kind of hairstyle they have, and how they walk. I even try to remember what clothes they wear. It's easy to recognise people by how they walk, because a lot of people walk very distinctively. When they move their upper torso, or even how the body proportions are, how long the legs are and so forth. It all influences how people walk, so this makes it very easy for me to recognise people. [...] I'm very conscious about that. Body movements, colour of clothing, and hairstyle become particularly important since they remain recognisable cues for Conrad. Although those with average eyesight too notice these aspects of those they interact with, this often remains implicit and has to be brought up directly before it is considered, as has been discussed with regard to habitus.18 This friction in fitting within designed environments and social situations whose assumptions rely on average eyesight calls particularly in unfamiliar situations for Conrad's so-called social hacking, a particular way of activating affordances, allowing him to explore novel kinds of relations that enable him to circumvent his special requirements. In social hacking, Conrad activates other affordances than people with average eyesight do, with the intention to approximate a socially accepted behaviour that does not reveal his visual impairment. When I go through the world, one technique that I use is that I always ask people a lot of things if I can't see it or get that information at the moment. So I would even ask indirectly whether something is going on in the street. If I don't see what's going on, I ask people what it is. Ordering food at a restaurant might be such a situation. If it is Conrad's first time at the restaurant and its offerings are not known to him beforehand, Conrad has to rely on a variety of techniques that those with average eyesight do not need. Since he is often unable to read the menu, which where we met (in San Francisco's Bay Area) was often behind the counter, Conrad has to socially hack. Because he cannot identify what is on offer, he has to ask for recommendations, order what someone else is eating or has ordered, just point at some food, or ask about food for special diets (such as vegetarian food). These social hacks circumvent the problem that designed environments do not always afford him the same information that these environments do for those with average eyesight. Many of these social hacks might be used by those with average eyesight as well, but then for other reasons than not being able to read the menu behind the counter. Also, computation devices allow Conrad to gather information about upcoming situations, helping him navigate in environments he cannot see. These devices allow Conrad to plan some of his actions in advance, so that he knows how to act in social situations that entail partial reliance on average eyesight. One of his situational social hacks is to look up the menu of a restaurant on that venue's Web site before going there, so that he knows what is available. The role that these devices receive in Conrad's day-to-day life has become very intimate, since they help him to expand his experiences of the environment, affording him relations he might not engage in without them. As Conrad points out, these devices become a bit like friends, in that they facilitate his every day. They help me a lot, I give an input and the machine replies. All of them actually have a name: my computer, my phone, my Kindle. I name them. They are active, they reply to what I say. Whereas, for Conrad, eyeglasses feel like a part of the body, computation devices end up taking on social roles, since they are even more integral to the many social situations he can navigate with their aid. Both glasses and computation devices enable him to activate affordances in designed environments that otherwise do not fit his requirements. CONCLUSIONS Conrad's account of visual frictions in the course of his everyday life provides a case in point for considering how the physiological substrate for vision and the social construction of visuality are intertwined. The notion of activated affordances is helpful for stressing the relationality between these two with regard to the particular environments under discussion, by enabling particular attention to be paid to why some affordances are activated instead of others. Conrad's use of social hacking is a way to circumvent some of the restrictions he has for activating affordances in environments designed for those with average eyesight. In social hacking, Conrad seeks to activate other affordances in order to act in socially acceptable and meaningful ways, without having to take up the role of being visually impaired. Instead, he can act along with others taking other primary social roles, such as that of a student, an employee, or a young man, for example. For studies in visual culture, this case provides examples for considering both the role of embodied practices and that of material environments for grasping vision and visuality. Presentation of this material in textual form and also as a multimedia narrative allows for the depiction of slightly different readings, which get experienced differently. In line with who the reader or viewer is, this text and the accompanying video afford different kinds of relations, and perhaps some of these might get activated in unforeseen ways. With his eloquent descriptions of how he experiences his surroundings, Conrad reminds me of how we all deal with special requirements, all the time. Vision tests might prove that I see in a manner conforming to the ideals behind these tests, but the test results say little about the variance in seeing that we all experience. Aching, sore eyes after a day at a monitor or when out in the wind; the eyelids closing when one is trying to remain awake; and the assault of brightness after a night in the dark woods all are ways of seeing that entail a need to adapt to designed environments if one wants to take up a relation with them, thus activating an affordance. Acknowledgements This work would not have been possible without Conrad, who patiently and articulately told me about his ways of seeing and let me use his story originally as part of the attached video. In addition, Nancy Van House was particularly helpful in encouraging work on multimedia narrations and gave me the opportunity to follow and take part in the course she was leading at UC Berkeley. I am grateful also for the encouragement I received from friends and colleagues who have seen the video, particularly John Scott and Anna Shefl. Karin Becker was very helpful when I decided to complement the original video with the above text, and various colleagues within the Nordic Network for Digital Visuality have assisted greatly by showing me ways of combining textual and visual work within an academic framework. I would also like to thank colleagues at Locating Media for thoughtful discussions. Notes 1. See also Hal Foster, ""Preface,"" in Vision and Visuality, ed.

VISUAL FRICTIONS Sensory experiences of digital photo-sharing--""mundane frictions"" and emerging learning strategies Vaike Fors* School of Education, Humanities, and Social Sciences, Halmstad University, Sweden Abstract Digital technologies are increasingly ubiquitous in everyday life forming part of the way we live and experience the world. This article will specifically scrutinise how mobile phone cameras, digital photographing and the use of web-based photo-sharing sites and communities become part of the meaning-making practices through which the everyday is lived and understood. In doing so, I advance the concept of ""mundane friction"" through which to discuss the experience, meaning-making and pedagogy generated through operating screen-based technologies. Indeed, media participates in everyday worlds beyond its role as a provider of content and for communication. The question that will be addressed here is how this media presence can be understood from an embodied and sensory perspective, and is based in a study of sensory aspects of teenagers use of web-based photo-diaries. Further, this discussion leads to questions of how an appreciation of digital visuality as more than representational acknowledges the meaning of mundane friction caused by habitually touching, rubbing, clicking, pinching through media technologies as part of the sensory emplacement process that establish people as situated learners. In turn, problematising this tangible friction as pivotal for understanding digital visuality gives reason to argue for research methods that acknowledge digital visual material as more-than-visual and theory that moves toward the unspoken, tacit and sensory elements of learning in everyday practices. Thus, the aim of this article is to elaborate on the embodied, the methodological and the pedagogical dimensions of ""mundane friction"" in meaning-making activities, and its pedagogical implications. 28237_UF0001.jpg Vaike Fors is a teacher and researcher at Halmstad University in Sweden.

Where in the World? A Mars Rover Globally Collaborative STEAM Project,"When people were forced to isolate themselves physically during the pandemic, many new connections sprung up through the Internet. In order to promote this newfound global oneness and to facilitate global education, this article examines a STEAM activity that promotes a holistic approach to education and make way for a global citizenry as students and educators collaborate to discover solutions to the most pressing worldwide issues. This activity was undertaken by a fifth-grade teacher in Houston, Texas, working with a group of about eight students and their teacher from a school in Sao Paolo, Brazil. The students in the United States were working on a unit about matter and identifying materials through observations and measurements. A focus on engineering practices facilitated the global collaboration. The mission was to build a rover that will be able to travel on Mars. The activity was executed remotely with the goal of promoting a shared collaborative partnership between the American and Brazilian teams. The teams from two different locales need to share ideas to make a prototype that will travel for at least one meter. The object is for them to create the same rover within each group through their discourse.

Wireless Drop Tower for Microgravity Demonstrations. Educational Brief,"Microgravity-the absence or reduction of some of the effects of gravity-is an important attribute of free-fall. In microgravity (often incorrectly called zero-g), water no longer flows ""downhill"" and neither do smoke or steam bubbles rise. This changes a number of chemical and physical activities. Experiments in combustion, fluid behavior, materials formation, cell science, and even fundamental physics formed an important part of the research conducted aboard the Space Shuttle in the 1980s and '90s. This educational brief for grades 9-12 provides assembly instructions for constructing a mini drop tower.

Multi-Walled CNTs/BiVO<sub>4</sub> Heterostructures for Solar-Driven Evaporation System and Efficient Photocatalytic Activity against Oxytetracycline,"Developing a sustainable environment requires addressing primitive water scarcity and water contamination. Antibiotics such as oxytetracycline (OTC) may accumulate in the environment and in the human body, increasing the risks to the ecosystem. The treatment of polluted water and the production of potable water can be achieved in a variety of ways, including photodegradation, solar distillation, and filtration. Freshwater supplies can be increased by implementing energy-efficient technologies for the production of clean water. Solar water evaporation combined with photocatalytic degradation and sterilization offers a promising avenue for integration into the clean water and energy production fields. The present study reports the synthesis of a 3D solar steam generator comprised of BiVO 4 and carbon nanotubes (CNT) nanocomposite decorated over a cigarette filter as the light-to-heat conversion layer for solar steam generation. The BiVO 4 @CNT-based 3D solar evaporator over the hydrophilic cellulosic fibers of the cigarette filter endowed excellent evaporation rates (2.36 kg m −2 h −1 ) under 1 kW m −2 solar irradiation, owing to its superior hydrophilicity and broadband solar absorption (96%) equipped with localized heating at microscale thermal confinement optimized by the minimum thermal conductivity of the overall system. Furthermore, the BiVO 4 @CNT composite exhibited a heightened photo activity up to 83% of the photodegradation of oxytetracycline (OTC) antibiotic due to the inhibition of charge recombination from the industrial effluents. This approach transforms the water-energy nexus into a synergistic bond that offers opportunities to meet expected demand, rather than being competitive.",False,No,1.

Using Direct Solar Energy Conversion in Distillation via Evacuated Solar Tube with and without Nanomaterials,"As is widely known, the issue of freshwater scarcity affects practically all people, and all are looking for innovative and workable ways to attempt to solve this issue. In this work, a novel method of desalination is proposed. The proposed system consists of a solar collector (PTSC), evacuated pipe (EP), condenser (CU), and separation unit (SU). The working principle of the system is heating the feed saline water using the PTSC and EP and controlling the water flow rate to control the output conditions of the EP. The produced vapor is therefore separated from salty water using the SU. In addition, the generated steam is condensed into the CU to produce a freshwater distillate. Consequently, the effect of solar radiation on the affecting temperatures was tested. In addition, the effect of using different water flow rates (6, 7.5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 L/h) inside the EP on the system productivity was investigated. The primary findings of this work may be highlighted in relation to the experiments conducted. At midday, when ultraviolet irradiance reached its highest, the EP’s water flow entrance and outflow had the largest temperature differential. In addition, the lower the water flow rate inside the EP, the higher the water temperature, the higher the evaporation rate of the system, and the greater the freshwater productivity of the system. At 6 L/h, the water’s highest temperature was 92 °C. Moreover, the best performance of the system was obtained at 7.5 L/h, where the freshwater production and average daily effectiveness of the distillate process were 44.7 L/daytime and 59.6%, respectively. As well, the productivity of EP was augmented by around 11.86% when using graphite nanoparticles. Additionally, the distilled freshwater from the system operating at the flow rate of 7.5 L/h costs 0.0085 $/L.",False,No,2.

Overview of Solar Steam Devices from Materials and Structures,"The global shortage of freshwater supply has become an imminent problem. The high energy consumption of traditional desalination technology cannot meet the demand for sustainable energy development. Therefore, exploring new energy sources to obtain pure water has become one of the effective ways to solve the freshwater resource crisis. In recent years, solar steam technology which utilizes solar energy as the sole input source for photothermal conversion has shown to be sustainable, low-cost, and environmentally friendly, providing a viable low-carbon solution for freshwater supply. This review summarizes the latest developments in solar steam generators. The working principle of steam technology and the types of heating systems are described. The photothermal conversion mechanisms of different materials are illustrated. Emphasis is placed on describing strategies to optimize light absorption and improve steam efficiency from material properties to structural design. Finally, challenges in the development of solar steam devices are pointed out, aiming to provide new ideas for the development of solar steam devices and alleviate the shortage of freshwater resources.",False,No,2.

Design and Performance Analysis of a Novel Integrated Solar Combined Cycle (ISCC) with a Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Bottom Cycle,"The integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC) system is a proven solution for grid-connected power generation from solar energy. How to further improve the ISCC system efficiency and propose a more efficient system solution has become a research focus. A novel gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC) benchmark system is proposed by replacing the conventional steam Rankine bottom cycle with a supercritical CO 2 Brayton cycle, whose output power and efficiency are increased by 9.07 MW and 1.3%, respectively, compared to those of the conventional GTCC system. Furthermore, the novel ISCC systems are established with the parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) and the solar tower (ST) collector coupled to the novel GTCC system. Thermal performance analysis, exergy performance analysis, and the sensitivity analysis of the ISCC systems have been performed, and the results show that the system efficiencies of both ISCC systems are lower than that of the GTCC system, at 57.1% and 57.5%, respectively, but the power generation of the ISCC system with PTC is greater than that of the benchmark system, while that of the ISCC system with ST is less than that of the benchmark system. The photoelectric efficiency of the ISCC system with PTC is 27.6%, which is 2.1% greater than that of ISCC system with ST. In the ISCC system with PTC, the components with the highest exergy destruction and the lowest exergy efficiency are the combustion chamber, and PTC, respectively. ST is the component with the highest exergy destruction and the lowest exergy efficiency in the ISCC system with ST. With the increase in direct normal irradiance (DNI), the total output power, solar energy output power, and photoelectric efficiency of the ISCC system with PTC increase, while the system efficiency decreases; the solar energy output power and photoelectric efficiency of the ISCC system with ST increase, while the total output power and system efficiency decrease. The photoelectric efficiency of the ISCC system with PTC is greater when the DNI is greater than 600 W/m 2 ; conversely, the photoelectric efficiency of the ISCC system with ST is greater. After sensitivity analysis, the optimal intercooler pressure for the ISCC system is 11.3 MPa.",False,No,2.

A novel dual feedwater circuit for a parabolic trough solar power plant,"The validated dynamic model of a parabolic trough power plant (PTPP) is improved by the combination of a new feedwater circuit (feedwater/HTF circuit) and a reference feedwater circuit (feedwater/steam circuit) as well as the development of the steam turbine model. Such design represents the first effort of research to utilize a dual feedwater circuit inside the PTPP to increase the power output in the daylight from 50 to 68 MW el and raise night operating hours at a lower cost. The purpose of increasing the operating night hours at a power (48 MW el ) as in the reference PTPP is to get rid of the fossil fuel backup system and rely only on the absorbed solar energy and the stored energy in the molten salt. During daylight hours, the feedwater circuit is operated using Feedwater/HTF. In the transient period, the feedwater/HTF circuit will gradually be closed due to a decrease in solar radiation. Furthermore, the rest of the nominal feedwater mass flow rate (49&#xa0;kg/s) is gradually replenished from the feedwater/steam circuit. After sunset, the entirety of the feedwater is heated based on the steam extracted from the turbine. The purpose of this improvement is to raise the number of nightly operational hours by reducing the nominal load from 61.93 to 48&#xa0;MW el as a result of low energy&#xa0;demand during the evening hours. Therefore, a comparison study between the reference model and this optimization&#xa0;(optimization&#xa0;2) is conducted for clear days (26th–27th/June and 13th–14th/July 2010) in order to understand the influence of dual feedwater circuit. The comparison indicates that the operational hours of the power block (PB) will be obviously increased. Moreover, this improvement reduces based on the fossil fuel system at night. As the last step, an economic analysis was performed on the costs of the referenced and the optimized PTPP as a function of the levelized energy cost (LEC). The results illustrate that the specific energy cost of a PTPP with 7.5&#xa0;h of storage capacity is lowered by about 14.5% by increasing the output of the PTPP from 50 to 68 MW el .",False,No,2.

Superelastic 3D Assembled Clay/Graphene Aerogels for Continuous Solar Desalination and Oil/Organic Solvent Absorption,"Superelastic, arbitrary-shaped, and 3D assembled clay/graphene aerogels (CGAs) are fabricated using commercial foam as sacrificial skeleton. The CGAs possess superelasticity under compressive strain of 95% and compressive stress of 0.09–0.23&#xa0;MPa. The use of clay as skeletal support significantly reduces the use of graphene by 50%. The hydrophobic CGAs show high solvent absorption capacity of 186–519 times its own weight. Moreover, both the compression and combustion methods can be adopted for reusing the CGAs. In particular, it is demonstrated a design of 3D assembled hydrophilic CGA equipped with salt collection system for continuous solar desalination. Due to energy recovery and brine transport management promoted by this design, the 3D assembled CGA system exhibits an extremely high evaporation rate of 4.11&#xa0;kg&#xa0;m −2 &#xa0;h −1 and excellent salt-resistant property without salt precipitation even in 20&#xa0;wt% brine for continuous 36&#xa0;h illumination (1&#xa0;kW&#xa0;m −2 ), which is the best reported result from the solar desalination devices. More importantly, salts can be collected conveniently by squeezing and drying the solution out of the salt collection system. The work provides new insights into the design of 3D assembled CGAs and advances their applications in continuous solar desalination and efficient oil/organic solvent adsorption.",False,No,1.

Selection of working fluids for solar organic Rankine cycle—A review,"The performance of renewable energy systems can be significantly improved if power is produced from low‐temperature heat sources. The organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is suitable for producing power from low‐temperature heat sources. ORC finds applications alongside solar power, geothermal power, waste heat and biomass. ORC‐enabled systems can contribute significantly to raising the effectiveness of renewable power sources. Solar power, for example, can deliver affordable electricity to remote locations and small industries. By employing ORC, power generation is possible at lower temperatures on cloudy days. Its main difference from the steam Rankine cycle is its working fluid. The ORC makes use of an organic, high molecular mass fluid as the working fluid. Compared to steam Rankine cycles, ORC works at a lower temperature (&lt;250°C) and pressure. The only working fluid in the steam Rankine cycle is water, but the ORC can operate on hundreds of different working fluids. The design and performance of ORC systems are entirely dependent upon the suitable working fluid and, hence identification of the working fluid for ORCs is of utmost importance for diverse applications. Properties of working fluid have a considerable impact on the efficiency of the system. The main objective of this study is to identify the most suitable organic fluids having characteristics necessary for use in solar ORCs. In addition, a detailed review of the various types of heat transfer fluids now available in the market that are often used in ORC systems was conducted. This research assists in selecting the most appropriate organic fluids for various solar ORC applications in terms of operating circumstances.",False,No,1.

Nanocomposite-Enhanced Efficient Evaporation System for Solar-Driven Seawater Desalination—An Optimized Design for Clean Water Production,"Solar-driven evaporation is a promising technology for desalinating seawater and wastewater without mechanical or electrical energy. The approaches to obtaining fresh water with higher evaporation efficiency are essential to address the water-scarcity issue in remote sensing areas. Herein, we report a highly efficient solar evaporator derived from the nanocomposite of anatase TiO 2 /activated carbon (TiO 2 /AC), which was coated on washable cotton fabric using the dip-dry technique for solar water evaporation. The ultra-black fabric offers enhanced solar absorption (93.03%), hydrophilic water transport, and an efficient evaporation rate of 1.65 kg/m 2 h under 1 kW m −2 or one sun solar intensity. More importantly, the sideways water channels and centralized thermal insulation of the designed TiO 2 /AC solar evaporator accumulated photothermal heat at the liquid and air interface along with an enhanced surface temperature of 40.98 °C under one sun. The fabricated solar evaporator desalinated seawater (3.5 wt%) without affecting the evaporation rates, and the collected condensed water met the standard of drinking water set by the World Health Organization (WHO). This approach eventually enabled the engineering design groups to develop the technology pathways as well as optimum conditions for low-cost, scalable, efficient, and sustainable solar-driven steam generators to cope with global water scarcity.",False,No,2.

Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>/Diatomite-Decorated Cotton Evaporator for Continuous Solar Steam Generation and Water Treatment,"Improving the evaporation rate of solar steam generation (SSG) has always been a research hotspot to solve the shortage of water resources. Using cotton, Fe 3 O 4 , polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and diatomite (DM) as raw materials, DM/PVA/Fe 3 O 4 @cotton composites with both firmness and hydrophilicity were prepared. Fe 3 O 4 has a wide range of light absorption characteristics and good photothermal conversion performance, and is an ideal photothermal conversion material. PVA enhances the adhesion between Fe 3 O 4 , cotton and DM and enhances the hardness of the sample and the internal porous structure. The existence of DM greatly improves the hydrophilicity of the sample, ensuring that the water in the lower layer can be continuously transported to the surface of the sample, and DM makes the surface of the sample rough, which reduces the reflection of sunlight and improves the efficiency of light heat conversion. Under one-sun irradiation, the temperature of the sample surface increases by 52.6 °C, the evaporation rate can reach 1.32 kg m −2 h −1 and the evaporation efficiency is 82.9%. Using this sample as the photothermal conversion layer of the SSG device, the removal rate of salt ions in seawater is more than 98% and the removal rate of heavy metal ions in sewage is close to 100%. This work provides a new idea and design method for SSG in the field of seawater desalination and sewage treatment.",False,No,2.

Edge Computing for IoT-Enabled Smart Grid: The Future of Energy,"The explosive development of electrical engineering in the early 19th century marked the birth of the 2nd industrial revolution, with the use of electrical energy in place of steam power, as well as changing the history of human development. The versatility of electricity allows people to apply it to a multitude of fields such as transportation, heat applications, lighting, telecommunications, and computers. Nowadays, with the breakout development of science and technology, electric energy sources are formed by many different technologies such as hydroelectricity, solar power, wind power, coal power, etc. These energy sources are connected to form grid systems to transmit electricity to cities, businesses and homes for life and work. Electrical energy today has become the backbone of all modern technologies. To ensure the safe, reliable and energy-efficient operation of the grid, a wide range of grid management applications have been proposed. However, a significant challenge for monitoring and controlling grids is service response time. In recent times, to solve this problem, smart grid management applications based on IoT and edge computing have been proposed. In this work, we perform a comprehensive survey of edge computing for IoT-enabled smart grid systems. In addition, recent smart grid frameworks based on IoT and edge computing are discussed, important requirements are presented, and the open issues and challenges are indicated. We believe that in the Internet of Things era, the smart grid will be the future of energy.

A reconfigurable and magnetically responsive assembly for dynamic solar steam generation,"Interfacial solar vapor generation is a promising technique to efficiently get fresh water from seawater or effluent. However, for the traditional static evaporation models, further performance improvement has encountered bottlenecks due to the lack of dynamic management and self-regulation on the evolving water movement and phase change in the evaporation process. Here, a reconfigurable and magnetically responsive evaporator with conic arrays is developed through the controllable and reversible assembly of graphene wrapped Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. Different from the traditional structure-rigid evaporation architecture, the deformable and dynamic assemblies could reconfigure themselves both at macroscopic and microscopic scales in response to the variable magnetic field. Thus, the internal water transportation and external vapor diffusion are greatly promoted simultaneously, leading to a 23% higher evaporation rate than that of static counterparts. Further, well-designed hierarchical assembly and dynamic evaporation system can boost the evaporation rate to a record high level of 5.9 kg m −2 h −1 . This proof-of-concept work demonstrates a new direction for development of high performance water evaporation system with the ability of dynamic reconfiguration and reassembly. Despite a promising water harvesting approach solar steam generation low efficiency remains a challenging obstacle. Here, authors present a macro- and microscopically reconfigurable and magnetically responsive assembly towards a dynamic evaporation system with improved performance and salt resistance.",False,No,2.

Numerical Simulation Study on Flow Heat Transfer and Stress Distribution of Shell-and-Tube Superheater in Molten Salt Solar Thermal Power Station,"The flow heat transfer and stress distribution of the shell and tube superheater of the steam generation system in a 50 MW molten salt tank solar thermal power station are studied by numerical simulation, and the influence of the flow pattern of molten salt and water vapor in the shell-and-tube superheater on the heat transfer efficiency and stress distribution under the heat–fluid–solid coupling condition is deeply studied. When the water vapor is located on the tube side of the superheater, the molten salt is located on the shell side, and the counterflow is used in the superheater, the water vapor outlet meets the inlet temperature of the steam turbine, and the heat exchange efficiency of the superheater can reach 94.2%. The optimum inlet temperatures of molten salt and steam in the superheater are 563 and 345 °C, respectively, and the optimum flow rate of molten salt at the inlet of the superheater is 2.5 m/s. Compared with the stable condition, the heat exchange efficiency can be increased by 2.9%, the equivalent stress value is reduced from 335.63 to 312.60 MPa, and the deformation is reduced by 0.48 mm.",False,No,1.

In situ synthesizing C‐CuO composite for efficient photo‐thermal conversion and its application in solar‐driven interfacial evaporation,"In this work, we in situ synthesized C‐CuO composite by a facile solid phase grinding for efficient photo‐thermal conversion. Moreover, surface morphology, hydrophilicity property, light absorption characteristic, and evaporation performance were investigated on C‐CuO membrane. It can be seen that C‐CuO composite was well dispersed on the membrane, prompting light harvesting and intentionally encouraging water evaporation. The surface hydrophilicity assisted valid water flow by the membrane toward the heat localization zone and smooth steam escape. At a calcination temperature of 250°C and a mass ratio of 1:1 regarding the preparation of C‐CuO composite, surface temperature of C‐CuO membrane reached to the maximum value around 87.4°C, noticeably stimulating the conversion of water to vapor. Further, the evaporation system with 0.015 g C‐CuO composite loading possessed top‐quality evaporation performance with superior recyclability, which mirrored to 92.6% evaporation efficiency and 1.34 kg m −2 hours −1 evaporation rate after 30 minutes exposure to light, respectively. Our work suggested that in situ synthesized C‐CuO composite was regarded as a potential alternative for clean water production by solar‐driven interfacial evaporation.",False,No,1.

"A Scalable Prototype by In Situ Polymerization of Biodegradables, Cross-Linked Molecular Mode of Vapor Transport, and Metal Ion Rejection for Solar-Driven Seawater Desalination","Water scarcity in mass populated areas has become a major global threat to the survival and sustainability of community life on earth, which needs the prompt attention of technological leadership. Solar evaporation has emerged as a renewable energy resource and a novel technique for clean water production and wastewater treatment. Indeed, mounting a scalable solar evaporator including high evaporation efficiency and thermal management remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a self-floatable, ecofriendly polypyrrole/wood sponge-based (PPy@WS) steam generator. The low-cost and easy to fabricate evaporator system consists of a single-step in situ polymerization of a 2-D (two-dimensional) hydrophilic wood sponge abundantly available for commercialization. The as-prepared PPy@WS solar evaporator exhibits excellent wettability and is super hydrophilic (contact angle ∼ 0), salt-resistant, and has an excellent light absorption of ∼94% due to omnidirectional diffusion reflection in PPy Nanoparticles (NPs). The capacity of the PPy@WS evaporator to absorb broadband solar radiation and convert it into thermal energy has enabled it to achieve excellent surface temperature (38.6 °C). The accumulated heat can generate vapors at the rate of 1.62 kg·m −2 ·h −1 along with 93% photothermal conversion efficiency under one sun (1 kW·m −2 ). Moreover, the presented prototype possesses the capability to be installed directly without the use of any complex protocol to purify seawater or sewage with an efficient rejection ratio of primary metal ions present in seawater (approximately 100%). This simple fabrication process with renewable polymer resources and photothermal materials can serve as a practical model towards high-performance solar evaporation technology for water-stressed communities in remote areas.",False,No,1.

Advances in Solar‐Driven Hygroscopic Water Harvesting,"Water scarcity is one of the greatest global challenges at this time. Significant efforts have been made to harvest water from the air, due to widely available water sources present in the atmosphere. Particularly, solar‐driven hygroscopic water harvesting based on the adsorption–desorption process has gained tremendous attention because of the abundance of solar energy in combination with substantial improvements in conversion efficiency enabled by advanced sorbents, improved photothermal materials, interfacial heating system designs, and thermal management in recent years. Here, recent developments in atmospheric water harvesting are discussed, with a focus on solar‐driven hygroscopic water harvesting. The diverse structural designs and engineering strategies that are being used to improve the rate of the water production, including the design principles for sorbents with high adsorption capacity, high‐efficiency light‐to‐heat conversion, optimization of thermal management, vapor condensation, and water collection, are also explored. The current challenges and future research opportunities are also discussed, providing a roadmap for the future development of solar‐driven hygroscopic water harvesting technology.",False,No,1.

Reduced Graphene Oxide–Based Spectrally Selective Absorber with an Extremely Low Thermal Emittance and High Solar Absorptance,"Carbon‐based black materials exhibit strong solar absorptance (α solar &gt;0.90), which play key roles in transforming solar energy into available power for solar‐thermal, thermophotovoltaic, thermoelectric, and many other systems. However, because of high thermal emittance (&gt;95%), these carbon‐based materials always cause huge energy loss that hinders the solar‐thermal conversion efficiency tremendously. In this study, a reduced graphene oxide–based spectrally selective absorber (rGO‐SSA) is demonstrated, which possesses a recorded low thermal emittance (≈4%) and high solar absorptance (α solar ≈ 0.92) by easily regulating the reduction level of inner 2D graphene sheets. Compared to conventional carbon‐based black materials, thermal emittance of this rGO‐SSA is largely reduced by ≈95.8% and the cutoff wavelength of rGO‐SSA is broadband‐tunable that can range from 1.1 to 3.2 µm. More importantly, this simply sol‐gel coated rGO‐SSA has high temperature tolerance at 800 °C for 96 h that is hardly achieved by other cermet‐based or photonic‐based SSAs. Based on this rGO‐SSA, ultrafast solar steam escape (0.94 mg cm −2 s −1 ) under concentrated solar irradiance is achieved directly. The insight from this study will provide a new strategy for constructing thermally stable carbon‐based SSAs and greatly facilitate the solar‐thermal practical significance.",False,No,1.

More importantly, this simply sol‐gel coated rGO‐SSA has high temperature tolerance at 800 °C for 96 h that is hardly achieved by other cermet‐based or photonic‐based SSAs. Based on this rGO‐SSA, ultrafast solar steam escape (0.94 mg cm −2 s −1 ) under concentrated solar irradiance is achieved directly. The insight from this study will provide a new strategy for constructing thermally stable carbon‐based SSAs and greatly facilitate the solar‐thermal practical significance.",False,No,1.

Dynamic characteristics of a solar‐aided coal‐fired power generation system under direct normal irradiance (DNI) feedforward control,"A solar‐aided coal‐fired power generation (SAPG) system is a new type of power generation system in the field of solar thermal power generation. However, the instability of solar radiation will cause fluctuations in steam temperature, which is unfavorable for the operation of boilers and steam turbines. Based on a 600&#xa0;MW subcritical coal‐fired power generation unit, TRNSYS software is applied to establish a transient simulation model of SAPG in this paper. A dynamic feedforward control system for steam temperature is set up. Some essential parameters, such as the fuel consumption rate, solar‐heated steam extraction rate, water spraying flow rate, and flue gas damper opening, are under the control of direct normal irradiance (DNI). Then, the dynamic characteristics of SAPG are analyzed using typical weather data. The simulation results show that under the fuel‐saving mode, when solar irradiation changes, the SAPG system achieves a coal reduction of 4.9% by using the steam temperature control system with DNI feedforward control, and the main steam temperature fluctuation is less than 5°C with the reheat steam temperature reduced within a reasonable range. The power generation fluctuation is less than 10&#xa0;MW, and the solar‐to‐electricity efficiency reaches 22.5%. Some parameters on both the flue gas side and the water/steam side in the utility boiler are simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of DNI control.",False,No,1.

Geothermal power generation in China: Status and prospects,"Geothermal resources provide green, low‐carbon, and renewable clean energy, with abundant reserves and massive potential for application. The in‐depth analysis of geothermal resources in China, including their distribution and breakdown by shallow, hydrothermal, and hot dry rock (HDR) resources, is made in this study. Using the recent economic reports and state‐of‐the‐art technological solutions, this survey outlines the latest trends in the geothermal power generation in China. The application of geothermal power generation in China is still at an early stage, with the total installed capacity of 27.78&#xa0;MW. The geothermal power generation technologies, such as dry steam technology, flash technology, binary cycle technology, and enhanced geothermal system (EGS), are briefly discussed and linked to their lucrative implementation sites. In particular, Tibet's Yangbajing is considered to be the most lucrative site for the EGS pilot project. The comparative analysis of low‐cost/large‐scale geothermal power generation technologies, such as low‐ to medium‐temperature one, solar‐geothermal hybrid one, and geothermal power generation in mines, was made, whose results strongly indicated the EGS technical and economical advantages. The concentration of 96% of China's population in the area to the east of Hu line affects the perspectives of high‐cost geothermal projects and has to be accounted in the comprehensive analysis of available data. Based on the revealed trends of geothermal resources’ development in China, the following guidelines are strongly recommended: comprehensive incorporation of geothermal energy generation into China's national energy and climate improvement plans, the rapid implementation of HDR technology, as well as comprehensive adaptation of the geothermal‐related projects to the local conditions/biased distribution of power consumers and state‐of‐the‐art challenges of power consumption.",False,No,1.

Integrating Geothermal Energy Education to an Engineering Technology Curriculum,"The theory and practice of the renewable energy and the sustainability education have been directly and indirectly included as new curriculum materials in many engineering and technology programs. Solar, wind, and Hydrogen fuel cell systems are available green energy technologies supported with customized educational trainers and modules in higher education institutions. Meanwhile other clean and alternative energy technologies such as geothermal heat pumps have steadily become an energy and cost efficient alternate to traditional heating and cooling systems. This require specifically engineering technology students to better gain competencies of geothermal energy for applying industrial, residential, and commercial geothermal systems in design, installation, testing, operating, data acquisition, monitoring and troubleshooting of related geothermal systems. However, due to larger laboratory space requirements, larger physical size and the higher initial cost of geothermal energy applications, many engineering and technology institutions were not able to include them in the curriculum, therefore simulation studies were the mostly an option for students to understand geothermal heat pump design and operation. Geothermal energy is the energy contained as heat in the Earth’s interior layer. The internal structure of the Earth together with the heat transfer mechanisms inside mantle and crust plays a significant role in the geothermal energy applications. Geothermal energy, as natural steam and hot water, has been exploited for decades to generate electricity, and both in space heating and industrial processes in many countries. This paper describes the curriculum enhancement for an existing junior level alternative energy class in a B.S. in Engineering Technology program by adding geothermal energy fundamentals and applications in it. The curriculum includes; (1) the analysis of refrigeration cycle on a pressure-enthalpy diagram using pressures and temperatures measured in a FESTO Didactic geothermal heat pump system, (2) obtaining coefficient performance (COP) and the energy efficiency ratio (EER) of a geothermal heat pump using measured temperature, humidity, voltage, and current values in normal and different loading scenarios for safe and effective operation. National Instrument’s LabVIEWTM software and myDAQ data acquisition module integrated with variety of sensors are also used as modern tools for the instrumentation and interfacing of the geothermal heat pump system that resulted in increased students’ interest to a traditionally mechanical engineering and technology application. This curriculum update serves as a major and minor class for multiple degree concentrations such as ECET, construction management, safety management, and engineering design and development in the department of engineering technology. The university’s recent strong partnership with a major energy services company also makes electrical power and renewable energy curriculum central to the University and College’s strategic planning that will produce future engineering technology graduates ready for implementing renewable energy technologies and applications on their areas of concentrations.",True,No,1.

Design and Analysis of Solar Desalination System Using Compound Parabolic Concentrator,Both in the developed and developing countries availability of drinking water is the main priority of human being. Fresh water available in nature 3% on the earth. This research is an attempt to use solar energy for conversion of hard water to soft water using compound parabolic concentrator. Soft water which is useful for drinking is in shortfall. This research is an attempt to haunt solar energy to desalinate hard water into portable water. A solar thermal desalination system has been proposed whereby heat from solar energy is utilised for heating hard (salt) water which is passed through cupper tubes and compound parabolic concentrator placed bottom of the cupper tubes to get maximum temperature in the form of steam. The steam thus formed is passed through a condenser where it condenses to get soft water. This theoretical analysis gives approximately 3-4 litres soft water per hour.

Thermodynamic Analysis of Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Power Cycle with Fluidized Bed Coal Combustion,"Closed supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO 2 ) Brayton cycle is a promising alternative to steam Rankine cycle due to higher cycle efficiency at equivalent turbine inlet conditions, which has been explored to apply to nuclear, solar power, waste heat recovery, and coal-fired power plant. This study establishes 300MW S-CO 2 power system based on modified recompression Brayton cycle integrated with coal-fired circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler. The influences of two stages split flow on system performance have been investigated in detail. In addition, thermodynamic analysis of critical operating parameters has been carried out, including terminal temperature difference, turbine inlet pressure/temperature, reheat stages, and parameters as well as compressor inlet pressure/temperature. The results show that rational distribution of split ratio to the recompressor (SR 1 ) achieves maximal cycle efficiency where heat capacities of both sides in the low temperature recuperator (LTR) realize an excellent matching. The optimal SR 1 decreases in the approximately linear proportion to high pressure turbine (HPT) inlet pressure due to gradually narrowing specific heat differences in the LTR. Secondary split ratio to the economizer of CFB boiler (SR 2 ) can recover moderate flue gas heat caused by narrow temperature range and improve boiler efficiency. Smaller terminal temperature difference corresponds to higher efficiency and brings about larger cost and pressure drops of the recuperators, which probably decrease efficiency conversely. Single reheat improves cycle efficiency by 1.5% under the condition of 600°C/600°C/25Mpa while efficiency improvement for double reheat is less obvious compared to steam Rankine cycle largely due to much lower pressure ratio. Reheat pressure and main compressor (MC) inlet pressure have corresponding optimal values. HPT and low pressure turbine (LPT) inlet temperature both have positive influences on system performance.",False,No,1.

Utilizing Design Sheets In The Design Of Energy And Thermal Systems,"In designing an energy system such as a steam power plant or a solar water heating system, an engineer is required to select and size many different components such as pumps, turbines, and solar panels. Proper selection and sizing of these components require understanding of materials covered in basic engineering science courses such as thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics. Moreover, the engineer must have knowledge and understanding of the overall system, the role of each component in the system design, and the interactions among different components. In addition, the selection and sizing process must conform to and follow industry standards and recommendations. As a result, many manufacturers provide design sheets to facilitate the design and selection process of their products. Even though the use of design sheet is prevalent in industry, many engineering textbooks in thermal/fluid sciences do not include or even describe them. This paper provides descriptions of some design sheets relevant to design of thermal and energy systems, and how they can be used in courses such as fluid mechanics, design of thermal systems, energy engineering, and energy conversion systems. For a practicing engineer in industry, it is common practice to be asked to choose or select a component to replace or upgrade an existing system. As an example, an engineer is asked to replace a pump supplying make-up water to the cooling tower in order to increase the flow rate of the make-up water supply. The engineer will need to evaluate several pumps in order to meet the flow rate required as well as other considerations such as size and cost of the pump, pressure drop in the piping system that the pump needs to overcome, selection of a motor to drive the pump, etc. The selection of pump will be commonly done using the design sheet or selection procedure provided by the manufacturer of the pump. The situation is similar for an engineer designing an energy or thermal system such as a solar water heating system. He/she is required to select solar panels, one or more water storage tanks, a pump, and other items such as a temperature controller, valves, piping, etc for the system in question. Proper selection and sizing of these components require understanding of materials covered in basic engineering science courses such as thermodynamics, heat transfer, and fluid mechanics. Moreover, the engineer must have a thorough knowledge and understanding of the overall system, the role of each component in the system design, and the interactions among different components. In addition, the selection and sizing process must conform to and follow industry codes, standards, and recommendations. As a result, many manufacturers provide design sheets to facilitate the design and selection process of their products. Even though the use of design sheets is prevalent in industry, many engineering textbooks in thermal/fluid sciences do not include or even describe them.

Development Of A Method To Fully Assess The Environmental Costs Of Electrical Energy Generation By Nuclear Power Plants,"A major problem affecting the assessment of the environmental and social costs of energy in addition to the monetary cost is a lack of standardization of assessment techniques which makes comparisons difficult or invalid. The University of Florida has adopted the EMERGY analysis process developed by Howard T. Odum1,2,3 to perform a self-consistent study of energy production to assess the full range of environmental, social and economic costs. The EMERGY analysis makes the ordering of energy values and the assignment of energy units (emjoules) to environmental and economic costs possible. The need for such a study arises from Federal directives for utilities to more fully assess the environmental and social costs of electricity production. The University of Florida has completed an implementable EMERGY analysis of a nuclear power plant that meets the spirit of the Federal directive. The development of the EMERGY analysis can serve as an example for utilities to follow in the future in their assessment of environmental and social costs. The reported study analyzes the integrated economic, energy, and environmental costs involved in the construction, maintainance, operation, and decommissioning of a steam nuclear power electric generating facility. Data were collected or calculated on the energy, economic, and environmental costs (emergy inputs) associated with the construction, operation, and decommissioning of a 1000 MW e nuclear power plant. These total energy cost data were analyzed and compared to the electrical output of the same size plant utilizing different fuel sources. The study shows that relatively low amounts of energy, economic, and environmental costs (in emergy units) are required to produce a given amount of electricity from the nuclear power plant compared to other electricity production options. The energy analysis employed in this study was an EMERGY analysis. The EMERGY concept is an accounting system or language that allows comparisons to be made between different energy systems or subsystems. An EMERGY analysis accounts for environmental and economic effects as well as direct energy and material use in a defined system. Each material, monetary quantity, or energy source is assigned an emergy value (in emjoules or sej's) based on how much solar energy it took to create it. The EMERGY inputs into the system under study are summed and divided into the energy output. The result is a ratio (EMERGY yield ratio), which indicates the efficiency and environmental impact within the system. This study yielded a ratio of 8.45 for a 1000 MWe nuclear power plant.

The Evolution Of An Energy Conversion Course At The United States Military Academy,"Over the past several years, an energy conversion course offered by the Mechanical Engineering Program at West Point has evolved into a cohesive series of lessons addressing three general topical areas: advanced thermodynamics, advanced mechanical system analysis, and direct energy conversion systems. Mechanical engineering majors enroll in Energy Conversion Systems (ME 472) during the fall semester of their senior year as an advanced elective. ME 472 builds directly on the material covered in Thermodynamics (EM 301) taken during the student’s junior year. In the first segment of ME 472, the students study advanced thermodynamic topics including exergy and combustion analyses. The students then analyze various mechanical systems including refrigeration systems, internal combustion engines, boilers, and fossil fuel-fired steam and gas turbine combined power plants. Exergetic efficiencies of various equipment and systems are determined. The final portion of the course covers direct energy conversion technology, including fuel cells, photovoltaics, thermoelectricity, thermionics, and magnetohydrodynamics. Supplemental lessons on energy storage, semi-conductors, and nonreactive energy sources (such as solar collectors, wind turbines, and hydroelectric plants) are included here. This paper discusses the evolution of ME 472 over the past several years and explains the motivations for the course’s progress. I. Introduction The United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point is the oldest engineering institution in the nation, having taught engineering science and design to students of military art since 1802. The Academy’s overarching general educational goal is “To enable its graduates to anticipate and to respond effectively to the uncertainties of a changing technological, social, political and economic world”. 1 The mission of the USMA is: “to educate, train, and inspire the Corps of Cadets so that each graduate is a commissioned leader of character committed to the values of Duty, Honor, Country; professional growth throughout a career as an officer in the United States Army; and a lifetime of selfless service to the nation.”1 Proceedings of the 2002 American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference &amp; Exposition Copyright © 2002, American Society for Engineering Education Main Menu",False,No,1.

Energy Production Systems. Energy Technology Series,"This course in energy production systems is one of 15 courses in the Energy Technology Series developed for an Energy Conservation-and-Use Technology curriculum. Intended for use in two-year postsecondary technical institutions to prepare technicians for employment, the courses are also useful in industry for updating employees in company-sponsored training programs. Comprised of seven modules, the course is an in-depth technical study of the processes and equipment used to convert fuels and energy resources into useful energy forms (electricity, heat, motion). The first four modules emphasize fuels and energy sources, examine their properties, and describe how they are used to produce steam and hot water. The final three modules emphasize how energy is used. Written by a technical expert and approved by industry, each module contains the following elements: introduction, prerequisites, objectives, subject matter, exercises, laboratory materials, laboratory procedures (experiment section for hands-on portion), data tables (included in most basic courses to help students learn to collect or organize data), references, and glossary. Module titles are Generation of Steam and Hot Water Using Solid Fuels; Generation of Steam and Hot Water Using Liquid and Gaseous Fuels; Generation of Steam, Hot Water, and Hot Air Using Solar Collectors; Generation of Steam and Hot Water Using Nuclear and Experimental Power Sources; Combustion Engines; Turbines; and Production of Electricity.
